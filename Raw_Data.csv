Higher abv , packs great flavor , and my local corner store sells it for $ 9 a six pack - pretty hard to go wrong .

The aromatic nose offers toasty malt and grassy and piney hops . On the palate , the malt is lightly sweet and moderately toasty rather really roasty , so the associated bitterness is mild .

The beer is medium bodied , medium in carbonation , and just dry enough for easy drinkability .

1068,"From a 12 oz Bottle . Pours a mostly transparent , brassy amber color with a thick layer of well sustaining snowy white head . Lots of spices in the nose , especially focusing on the nutmeg . Shades of cinnimon and a touch of pumpkin present , but it really seems focused on the spice character and not as much on the pumpkin . The pumpkin is there , it just does not have a meaty or juicy aroma . Some spicy herbal hops linger as well . Medium bodied , full carbonation that provides the tongue with a tiny shimmering bubble massage . Too much hops and even some higher fusel alcohols jump out on the palate right away , which seems a bit surprising considering the ABV is not really that high . The pumpkin character grabs the tongue briefly before a devasting juggernaut of hop bitterness destroys any semblence of pumpkin - esque chewy sweetness . The spices get a bit out of control at the backend as well , with the mace adding to the astringency of the hops and alcohol . This beer is not completely wrong , I just find myself evaluating it like it were one of my homebrews . If I were to brew this ""again"" , I would up the pumpkin , lower the IBUs , and ferment it at a lower temperature . But then again its not my beer .

A malty backbone supporting the ""Horn of Plenty"" if you will , complexities . Candied apples , black cherries , peaches , nectarines , and vanilla bean w / other nuances of new leather , tobacco , and spices dumped into a sandy gravel pit of granite shards . The Bourbon is defined and reminds me of the mellow luciousness of a 21 yr old Black Maple Hill .

Taste: delicate and light on the tongue , with a coffee flavour - think more a breakfast blend from a boutique roaster . Alcohol is well hidden . Mouthfeel: well carbonated , strangely thin but not in a bad way . The mouthfeel makes this beer *dangerously* drinkable - without any alcohol burn you could almost think this was a regular stout and drink it in that manner !

1250,"I had consumed a fair amount of this Pale Ale a few years ago , and happened to see a new shipment at my local BevMo .

1256,"22 oz bottle Thanks to buffalohead for sharing this bottle that he picked up on a recent trip . It makes me wish that I could take a trip to North Carolina some time as it seems the beer scene there is not exactly resting on its laurels . Id be curious to see what some of their lighter beers are like after having two of their bigger releases . Aroma / Appearance - A deep maroon liquid filled the glass like a fine port . The sticky sheets of clear lacing provided some proof that this was heavier than a normal beer . It looks like sheets of rain as they roll off a windshield . Warmth and alcohol rises like the heat from a flame . Sweetness and chewy aspects hover in the air . Flavor / Palate - Chewy , thick , and woody the palate is filled with creaminess . Like a melted Mars Bars it clings to every corner and does not let go for quite a while . Warmth from the alcohol begins to hit the senses after the third or fourth sip . Overall its not the greatest doppelbock but it is good enough to indicate whomever made it knew what they were doing . Hopefully their other beers follow the same trend .

There is a light bitterness and a bit of grassy hop , but the maltiness comes in and controls the back end . Its not overbearing in any fashion , but its definitely pretty bland . The flavor is much of the same . There is a light piney bitterness to the hops , and a hint of leafiness , before the malts come cruising in and offer a solid backbone .

The chocolate in the nose is almost non existent in the flavor . The coffee give this an acridic bitterness that is not overly enjoyable . Long lingering roasted grain and burnt coffee in the finish . The body is a bit on the thinner side for an Imperial Stout I would have mashed a little hotter or maybe added more crystal malt .

The smell is very caramel forward ( interesting as the bottle says ""chocolate oatmeal stout"" ) , but I have to admit it seems kind of off for the caramel tones coming out . After some warming up , I do get some roasty malts with some milk chocolate . The taste is kind of bitter and zesty ( I think I am getting some lemon through the flavoring ) . There is a strange zesty lemon / orange yet somewhat chocolate caramel aftertaste ( unsure how I really feel about this ) . There is no finish whatsoever . On the palate , it sits light on the body to show a decent sessionable aspect to it . Carbonation is fairly high in this one , some vinous - like qualities impart a harshness rolling around the mouth and tongue to instill a harsh lemon quality on the palate . Overall , this is interesting to say the least and exceptionally light for an oatmeal stout . There is not as much chocolate as expected by the side of the bottle . It would have been nice to see a date as I see its only 4 . 9 % ( I wonder when this was brewed last ) . Probably would not seek this out again ( just something that did not fit quite right with this one ) , though its nice to try a brew from a company I have never had before .

1303,"Procured at States Street Liquor from Redlands , California for $ 4 . 09 , Vanilla Pumpkin Beer is crafted by OFallon Brewery from Maryland Heights , Missouri . The smell of pumpkin , vanilla , and cinnamon are felt upon the nose . The appearance is a clear orange amber that pours a low white head that dissipates gradually with minimal lacing . When held up to light , the color shifts to a golden hue . The alcohol content is 5 . 6 % . Pumpkin flavors the complexion , and complimented by a moderately creamy feel of vanilla beans that smoothens the take . Biscuit malt lightly weighs the pumpkin and vanilla bean tandem . Cinnamon gently spices the take , and softly textures the mouthfeel . Nutmeg adds a bitter sweetness to the pumpkin , biscuit malt , and cinnamon mixture . Clove tones the pumpkin and cinnamon solution , and fairly peppers the slightly dry finish . Vanilla Pumpkin Beer is enticing . Pumpkin , vanilla beans , biscuit malt , cinnamon , nutmeg , and clove fuse into a delicious craft beer . The pumpkin and biscuit malt blend is colored by the spices . The cinnamon and clove notes linger into the finish . The vanilla beans give off the impression as if you are having a pumpkin pie with whip cream added to it . I cherished every single drink , and impressed how adding vanilla beans to OFallons base pumpkin beer turned it into one of my favorite desserts into a craft beer . Cheers . Prost .

Overall , a fairly nice beer , but I am not sure I see any ' gose ' from this one , this is all about a heavy fruit beer , showing more caramelised sugars and malt than any brine or salt aspects - this is deep and strong , in a good way , just not one for the style .

1353,"22 oz . bottle , consumed on 5 - 21 - 16 . Pours a cloudy , deep bronze with a slight apricot hue . Much suspended particulate in the liquid . Moderate effervescence . Very small amount of beige head; the lack of head is unfortunate . The final pour is murkier and has more head , albeit short - lasting . I feel mixed emotions about the appearance . Fruity , medicinal aroma is not what I anticipated . Scents of iodine , fruit tart baked good , and pink lemonade . Initially dry , bitter flavor . Iodine or medicinal quality from the aroma continues into the flavor . Apricot , lemonade , and pine needles . Like fruit juice or nectar sipped in an aromatic boreal forest . Some caramel sweetness balanced by a sharp , citric quality . Alcohol taste noticeable but not overwhelming . Bitter finish and aftertaste . Medium to full body , full for the style . Smooth yet lively in the palate . Improves upon multiple sips . Interesting and memorable beer , but I am not sure it comes together properly . For better or for worse , it tastes like it was brewed on a very small scale; not like homebrew but rather like nanobrew . Its more interesting yet less polished than most IPAs , especially bottled or canned IPAs that make it out of breweries taprooms . I added an extra point to the overall score for uniqueness . Part of me loves this beer; part of me considers it notably flawed . Those parts average out to earn it a mediocre rating . ",2016-05-28,pig-minds-sweep-the-leg,Pig Minds,3

1413,"12 ounce bottle from the brewery . This was bottled a week ago . I was told that this was being made for the local market in Chico , only . Looks like it may not be the actual case . The aroma has some grassy hop character and a light , sweet , honey - like malt nose , too . I also get a little caramel popcorn , too . Glistening , transparent amber body with a large , frothy , cream - colored head . Starts with a semi - sweet and almost nutty malt flavor .

1416,"From notes . Enjoyed at the 5 th Annual Barleywine Tasting at Travis and Nicoles house on February 03 . 22 oz bottle . The pour is a darker orange color with a thick light tan head and a couple spots of good , soapy lace as it falls down to a film . The aroma is interesting . There is a lot of bitter hop up front with a growing orange rind and some lighter caramel notes . There is a bit of cardboard coming through and a light alcohol on the finish . The flavor is much of the same . The bitterness and the resin are surprising . The cardboard - y caramel sweetness really is a little messy , and there is a bit of a grassiness on the finish . The mouth feel is lighter medium bodied and a sharply carbonated with a lingering bitterness and a strong hop finish . This one just is not for me .

Aftertaste shows the alcohol , pungent citrus and grapefruity notes , the resinous and dank bitterness and dry grassy finishes , but the rich malts and punch from the astringency is the strongest with a minor sweetness at the very end that tempers out the richness . Overall , a very strong and pungent Imperial IPA that shows tons of malts , alcohol , resin and bitterness that tastes and feels more like an ' old school ' Imperial IPA , but looks like the new ones !

Even so there might be worse brown ales . I am at least willing to give Moab Brewing another chance down the road . Aroma / Appearance - An ivory head graces a calm rusty brown hued foundation . Tea and malt tickle the air with a light sweetness that is unremarkable . Flavor / Palate - Carbonated iced tea splashes across the tongue before fading into a faint memory .

Lots of toastiness with a strangely noticeable burnt flavor . Grainy and bready malts . Again a good amount of toffee and caramel , but not much sweetness overall , at least not for the style .

A bit lighter than I like for the style . Good moderate carbonation . Could be creamier , but good smoothness . 3 . 5 D: Not a bad beer , but I expected this style to be perfected by THIS brewery .

1529,"2009 brandy barrel , into a snifter at Uber Tavern in Seattle . Appeared almost pitch black with minimal head . Smells very strongly of espresso and cream . Sort of weak up front , but it somehow gets stronger as you continue smelling . You can tell its very rich . Taste was sweet and syrupy , with a big alcohol burn . Again , lots of coffee , vanilla , and caramel . Palate was sticky with very little carbonation . It was a very powerful , full , full mouth beer . Big warming sensation . Overall , a real treat .

1531,"Poured into a snifter . Bottle # 25 , 160 from September 2007 . 3 . 0 A: Black color . Maybe a quarter finger of frothy light brown head that quickly fell and left no lacing . Ill cut it some slack since its so old . 5 . 0 S: This may be the strongest smelling and booziest of the series and also the best smelling . Tangy caramel , loads of chocolate , light coffee , vanilla combine to form a creme brulee type aroma . Molasses , a formitable earthiness , and peat and oak from the whiskey and barrel . Supple roast underneath . I would not ask for a much better nose , but if I did , Id ask for a little more sweetness . 3 . 0 T: The frailty of the base beer is quite apparent in the taste . Aside from roastiness and some chocolate , the taste is dominated by the whiskey instead of the whiskey playing complement to the base . Most of the flavors found in the nose are still there , but in vastly reduced amounts with chocolate , molasses , and caramel taking the biggest hits . Still a decent amount of vanilla and oak from the barrel and peat from the whiskey . Earthy mineral from the water . 2 . 0 M: Light to ligher medium body . Whatever the descriptors , its too thin . A good bit undercarbonated , but not quite flat . Lacking creaminess . 2 . 5 D: These beers smell great , but then ultimately disappoint . The base for these is weak and the barrel overshadows it by far too much . Only the 18 year to go , then I am done with this unsatisfying , overpriced series .

Medium - bodied; Quite assertive and astringent flavours that showcase the hops and caramelised sugars along with a big dose of malt , earth , toffee , grain and pungent alcohol at the very end that is very strong and not very mellow or rounded . Aftertaste shows a decidedly bitter , strong and sweet flavour that shows more of a scotch ale than an pale ale of any variety , but this still could use a few years in the bottle to make it a bit more refined , elegant , albeit perhaps less complex .

1562,"Transfer from BA review on 8 - 13 - 12 - Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass Appearance The beer is served a lightly hazed copper color with a nice one finger white head . The head has great retention , but eventually fades slowly over time to give a wonderful level of lacing . Smell The aroma is quite hoppy . The strongest is of a grapefruit hop , but other aromas of pine and an earthy nature are mixed in as well . Complementing the hop aroma is a nice sweet caramel smell that helps to balance the hop . Taste The taste begins with a slightly sweeter caramel malt and bready base . Mixed with this is a pine hop flavor that tingles the tongue . As the taste advances the bready flavor remains while some of the sweetness is lost once a good wallop of a bitter citrus hop comes to the tongue in the middle of the taste . More toward the end a little bit of booziness comes to the tongue where when mixed with the bitter hop and bready malt leaves a somewhat burring bitter on the tongue . Mouthfeel The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side while the carbonation is a touch below average . Both are great for the hoppy flavor profile and allow the tastes to really permeate the tongue . Overall A tasty double with a slightly sweeter start and more bitter finish .

1563,"Appearance - This beer pours a very dark brown with a thin , tan head that dissipates quickly . A little thicker head with more staying power would be nice . The lacing is incredible , leaving a gorgeous trail of tan matching the color of the transient head . Aroma - Strong coffee scent and not much else , though there are hints of the milk sugar as advertised on the bottle . Not a cornucopia by any means , but pleasing . Taste - This is where this beer really hits its stride . Initially , the coffee that was evident in the nose hits , though it is not as bitter as many coffee stouts are , undoubtedly due to the milk sugar . This ingredient is the key that puts this beer over the top; it imparts a slightly creamy , sweet ( though not overly so ) , and , simply put , delicious flavor that is incredibly drinkable and refreshing thanks to the exceedingly clean finish . Palate - This beer showers all parts of the mouth in a lively carbonation that is the antithesis of the quickly - departed foam , leaving a pleasant tingling throughout the mouth . The feel is a bit thin , unfortunately; I had expected a creamier texture to accompany the taste . It leaves a stickiness on the lips that some may find off - putting , but this drinker finds quite agreeable . Overall - For fans of the style , it will be difficult to come up with a better example . This beer makes up for its shortcomings in the nose and eye with its stellar performance in the mouth . As advertised , this is the beer equivalent of a cup of coffee , complete with cream . Perfect for any season thanks to its rich flavor and heavy carbonation , but these go down way too easy , a trait that is certainly only a bad thing for those with a light wallet .

There is a just a touch of roast in there to try and balance things out .

Nearly full bodied and slick on the palate with soft carbonation that leads to a lengthy dark chocolate and orange finish that lingers for awhile .

I was taken back with my first sip as the effervescence and tartness right off the bat was insane . After settling in , the roasted cherry skins come out . I got a deep earthiness and oak to round out the flavors as the liquid goes down the hatch . You know that taste when you finish a cherry popsicle and you chew on the popsicle stick for awhile ? that is what I was tasting even 10 - 15 minutes after I was done with this one .

Save the best for first ! And as far as I was concerned , this was the best of show ( though I got too drunk and had to leave before Duck Duck was opened , so who knows ) . Anyhow , the aroma was a pretty quickly decided 10 , for me . I started with not even an inch of glorious , clear , ruby liquid but even that yielded a bountiful , rich , very strong aroma of perfectly wedded sour acids . Acetic acid was gentle at this point and only added enough vinegar - like notes to punctuate the style while the malo - lactic portion was soft , rich and divine . Smelled like it had cherries jumping out of the glass . Tons of black pepper , cherry pit and very light vanilla . Bone dry tartness lingering . Wow , if this stuff smells this much like cherry , I wonder what the actual Kriek version is like . Beautifully flavorful , as well , with a very dry , light body , leaving only traces of candied prunes and light caramel while the lactic acid and black pepper phenols do all the work . Hints of light base malt sweetness provides excellent balance and the beer seems neither overly / obnoxiously sour , nor lacking in any sour character .

1683,"4 oz . poured into a snifter at Churchkey . From notes . A: Pours a dark tawny color with low clarity . The head is a one finger offwhite color with a thin ring sticking to the sides of the glass . S: Smoke . And lots of it . Really , you have to expect that coming into something that is from Bamberg . But other than the smoky notes , there is an underlying oak quality to it - and overwhelming plasticky phenols . Quite good , apart from the strong phenolic aroma . T: I half - expected this to be one massive smoke orgy . I did not expect it to be so impressively balanced behind a caramel malt backbone , oaky tannins , and the damn phenol notes . The finish is more smoky than the beginning , but never overdone . Each subsequent sip helps to balance the firepit - esque smoke with the maltiness increasingly . Would be great if not for the plasticky flavors . M: The texture is pseudo - creamy with a dry , tannic finish . Lower carbonation and decent drinkability . of: was not sure what to think at first , but I started to enjoy this more as I got near the end of my little sample , suggesting this is something that needs to be savored in larger quantities .

Overall a very unique , well done brew but its definitely a one try brew .

The mouthfeel is suberb as the drink hits with the right amount of punch to the let flavors capture your attention , but at the same time allowing them to run gently and smoothly down the back of your throat . If i would not have had bad connotations associated with past beer experiences with coriander prominence ( aka witbier ) , i would have enjoyed this one even more . With that said , this is still a very well made and unique piece of brewing that made for quite an enjoyable experience . ",2009-04-01,traquair-jacobite-ale,Traquair House,4
1737,"I have had Traquairs House Ale so many times I have lost count . I have only SEEN their Jacobite once and its in my hands and its time to rate it . I am glad I did because , like the House Ale , its quite enjoyable . The beer starts out with a dark brown / amber pour with a small / medium sized 1 - finger thick cap . The aromas I could detect were slightly fruity ( oranges and dates ) , a bit of brandy , toffee . even a bit of Pepsi somehow ( strange ) . A nicely sweetend flavor with notes of roasted malts , rum soaked raisins or maybe cherries and brandy . vanilla pops up too . A great winter time beer . Picked the perfect time to drink it too .

At first flavor is less complex than aroma - acerbic and alcohol forward - but I am drinking this at a cold temperature so I will let it warm up . As it warms the flavor develops a little more richness and melds better , but still quite rough . I have made mead before and know that it can take a good 1 - 2 years , I wonder if this was racked for long enough . Still , one of the better American takes on a mead I have had recently - as an eastern European fond of the style I wish there were more - and quite an adventurous twist with the local fruit juice .

This one pours very dark brown , darker than I was expecting with a small tan head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves only a trace of lacing .

Tons of dark roasted malts balance with the sweetness of the molasses - a perfectly balance combination with a hint of coffee and smoke in the nose as well . The taste picked up where the nose left off , with tons of caramel malts and some roasted coffee forming a solid backbone . The molasses really balances that roasted character before the finish provides a bit of chocolate sweetness and a hint of hops .

Has an almost overwhelming , wooden barrel character , which gets enhanced by an incredibly zesty , herbal , sweet spiciness , featuring glazed pumpkin and burning booze , all put into an intriguing balance . The brews complex , honeyed maltiness interacts well with the slighty fermented , earthy and sweet pumpkin , both smells blending together hold the barrel intensity at bay . This is so much sweeter than I expected it to be , with loads of molasses , toffee and cane sugar , kicking my teeths in , finished off wih an intense alcoholic burn , while the barrels woodenness gets almost swallowed entirely by the sugar . The malt foundations gets overpowered by the sweetness already during the very beginning , joined by a sharp alcoholic impact , and only manages to try finding its balance during a later stage , due to the calming herbs and spices , which all in all are not capable to stop the sugar madness too . The rum barrel is very well integrated though , providing a burning , slightly bitter counterpart to the sugar , which would result into a slightly dry , medicine - like impression , if it was not for the muddy , leafy herbs of mace , cardamon and vanilla , to provide some sort of balance .

Aroma - Molasses and brown sugar malt are the first aromas that come to mind . It is also slightly nutty due to some oxidation . It smells a bit like a high alcohol zinfandel .

Sometimes one encounters a highly rated beer only to be disappointed in the end . This was simply not the case . It ranks among the best beers I have enjoyed in the last 12 months . The mouthfeel is fabulous , viscous and rich , and sometimes one feels as if they are chewing an artisan caramel toffee candy .

A nice citrus to earthly hop profile in the nose with a good roasted malt backing . The flavors seem to showcase the deeper malt roast profile with additions of some coffee and some oatmeal and other grains . The mouth is pretty full boded with a heavy feeling after taste .

This is beautifully drinkable and expertly crafted . - The malts could be a tad crisper for my tastes . - The peaceful big bubbles complement the comfortable body , increasing drinkability . - A slight mineral character is perceived early on , but it is harder to perceive after a few gulps . - That finish is really compelling !

No thanks . ",2010-11-30,samuel-adams-chocolate-bock,Samuel Adams,3
1909,"Pours a thin dark brown , producing a short beige head that quickly recedes . The aroma is a fine milk chocolate and a bit of fruit , sort of raspberries . It has a nice rounded chocolate flavor , very silky , slightly toasty , not overly sweet . Has a dry cocoa finish . The palate is slightly thin , and avoids being sticky . Really very nice .

Flavor is decadently sweet chocolate wtih a buttery finish . Unlike any other chocolate I have sampled in a brew . The buttery finish seems out of place , but nice nonetheless .

I taste and can like the character of this Indian pale ale . It is enjoyable without the insulting hurricane gale . The finish is so odd for an IPA beer .

Brown sugar and molasses also prominent alongside hints of banana and dark fruits , reminiscent of a dark german lager . So far so good , and surpassing the blonde by some way ! Taste is a little harder to discern - malts rush to the forefront bringing bread , cereal and small hints of caramel . Some raisins and other dark fruits form the subtler middle notes . Small bitter malty notes to finish , along with more cereal All a little too subdued overall , and an overtly watery feel predominates much of the experience .

1930,"Towering before me in a bomber sized bottle , Great Divide pours cloudy amber - orange . While I am able to see through her depths , she is not crystal clear and to further prove her case , a thick head of foam nicely caps her peak . Melting slowly like snow caught in the cusp of spring , trickling trails of lace mark the sides of my glass . I do not need to bring her close to bask in her vibrant nose; massive amounts of pine , grapefruit of all varieties , honeycomb , oranges , and grass wet with dew just waiting to be cut . So far Hercules is living up to his reputation , and as I savor my first quaff , my senses surrender to his heavenly assault . Frothy with a medium - bodied mouthfeel , Hercules clings to the sides of my mouth and tongue with sticky sweet honey and orange pulp . As I find myself under the influence of sweet first impressions , an explosion of pine needles , pine sap , and cut grass wrestles my senses to the ground where I am surrounded by blossoming greenery and all the aromas and flavors which come with it . Not to be outdone , tangy and tart grapefruit is especially prominent in the finish , leaving a citric tingly sensation on the back of my tongue . Great Divide Hercules IPA is an Imperial IPA and throughout each quaff , a growing warmth reminds me of his prominent alcohol presence . No one wants a wimpy Hercules , after all . As I near the end of my glass , a continuous assault of pine needles and sap , sour grapefruit , and a burgeoning dryness leaves me thirsting for more long after I finish . I would have to say that the Great Divide Hercules IPA magnificently lives up to his reputation as the strongest man in the world , or , in the case of imperial IPAs , one of the strongest IPAs out there . But as we all know , strength is not everything , and what others sometimes fail to accomplish , Great Divide succeeds in masterfully: balance of flavor , complexity , and drinkability . I would have to say he is easily one of the best imperial IPAs I have quaffed to date . ",2009-03-24,great-divide-hercules-double-ipa,Great Divide,4

1950,"My first beer rating . I picked this up at the local bargain shop on offer , and did not realise exactly what I was getting into . My usual fare is just cheap lagers , as they are refreshing and crisp , and extremely cheap . However , after tasting this , my entire perspective on beer has been changed . I have always heard about fine beers with subtle notes , but never experienced one until now . I am a little unsure , so Ill be using the beer ratnig assistance to help me . Caramel , butterscotch , banana , and the boiled stalks of Alexanders are all present in the aroma for me . The aroma is sweet , rich and dark . I also noticed a slight tang of soy sauce , strangely . The appearance is gorgoeus , this being the darkest beer I have ever seen apart from Guinness ( yuck ) . Id estimate its roughly the colour of Coca Cola . The fluid itself is crystal clear , but so dark you cannot see through it . The head was white and relatively average , in my experiences . A fairly sweet beer , with a solid presence of bitterness as well . A fair twinge of sourness also mixes with this . It is quite salty , which intrigued me . I found this beer to be quite thin , with a slight oily sensation after swallowing . Its suprisingly fizzy to my tastebuds , but not massively so . This fizz is defintely not betrayed by the appearance of the drink , which has a surface as smooth as glass and no noticable bubbles . I notice the taste seems to last a long , LONG time after ingestion . I timed the length the flavour remained strong as being 32 seconds !

There are undertones of sweet citrus and coconut throughout . Aftertaste is bitter with just a light amount of sweetness that really balances it out . The aftertaste really lingers .

In the last 100 beers , I have had a chance to try many new styles , but I keep coming back to my original favorite . This beer has great color: an clear , fresh orange and it pours with a huge , off - white head that lingers . The aroma is fresh and inviting , in the mouth there are a medley of fresh citrus flavors with a decent yet only supporting malt backbone . I got orange , grapefruit , pine with a great dry and exceptionally long finish . An excellent beer . Special thanks to my wife , Peggy , for bringing this back from Atlanta , I wish that she had brought the entire 4 - pack ! ",2006-09-16,great-divide-hercules-double-ipa,Great Divide,4
1959,"2013 - Pours the color of black with a small tannish head . It definitely has a smoke aroma but there is something more , some kind of sweetness that I cannot put my finger on . I am kind of afraid that the taste will follow the nose , I cannot see how it cannot . I am scared . The aroma slaps me in the face when I go to drink it . Scareder . Taste does follow the nose but its not bad , yet . Maybe a Smokey caramel / chocolate flavor that seems to get easier to drink the more you drink ( that is a good thing with anything you drink ) . Overall a unique flavored beer that is really good but I do not know if its what I crave as a beer , but it is good . Hard for me to rate . ",2014-10-31,alaskan-smoked-porter,Alaskan Brewing,4
1960,"Draft at Brouwers Cafe Hopfest 06 . Dark amber , garnet color . Huge piney nose . Small head , light lace . Big dry biscuit malts in the mid - palate , though they are overwhelmed by harsh resins starting there and carrying through the finish . Crisp finish that keeps the door open for just a second , letting that cool hop breeze blow just a bit longer . The GF says it tastes like burnt berries . Not sure if that is good or bad , but it seemed accurate enough that I include it here for your consideration . ",2006-08-26,great-divide-hercules-double-ipa,Great Divide,4
1961,"This is divine sweet hop candy at its glorious peek . Appearance: Pours a deep copper color; orange amber , beautiful; with a big off - white head and sheets of heavy lacing . Smell: Thick malty aroma of orange , caramel , bread and grapefruit that is truly enticing . Taste: The flavor is sweet and malty like a fruit juice character but the fruit that has been juiced in the magnificent HOP ! Hop oils galore in the bold but balanced DIPA . I this genre Hercules is not the most bitter . It actually leans towards malty despite its big hop bitter . The hop character is more like lots of tiny hop bugs nibbling at your mouth than it is like a huge hop spike that is hammered straight through the roof of you mouth exiting your skull . The sweet hoppy flavor does not scramble your brain it only teases your sense to the point of elation and drops off just before wearing you out; making this an extremely drinkable DIPA . The finish is lip - smackingly dry; and the aftertaste is fantastic , leaving you wanting more . Mouthfeel: It feels like a medium body beer but the active nibbling hops create a sensational creaminess that makes the body feel more fluffy and yet exceptionally smooth . Drinkability: WOW ! What can I say ! This one down with exceptional easy . The finish is a bit dry but I like it that way . And the ABV , well , you would never know it; till you had a few . Is it a session beer ? Of course not at 9 . 1 % but Id easily put a few back; and I sure would not mind having a couple cases in the cellar to work on for the next several months . Hope this is helpful . Cheers !

Citrus , orange zest and coriander along with the signature Unibroue yeast . Not the type of belgian tripel with well hidden alcohol . This is a 9 % abv that tastes every percent of it . Strong but surprisingly refreshing because of its witbier side .

1977,"500 ml bottle November 2014 batch , semi - blind rating . Hazy gold with a short and fine - bubbled white head . First impression of the aroma is bacteria / wild yeast blend ( brett / must / cobwebs ) , hops as lemons , apricots , malt as hay and faint toast , with a strange note of cucumber . Medium bodied , lightly sweet , tart and acidic and sour with citric lemon juice . Fluffy carbonation gives way to sharp acids and faint oak and bitter green apples . Begins to smell like lemon or orange bitters in the way of a cocktail , I would believe they put lemon oil or zest in this since it seems to emerge with warmth , but there is also maybe some alcohol giving it a rye whiskey resemblance . Dried pineapple pieces , maybe some coconut shaving impression I get from the oak , which is nicely minimal . All around solid wild yeast Belgian - ish beer , and blind I would peg this for a Sour / Wild rather than Saison . ",2015-07-14,forest-main-moeder-seizoen,Forest & Main,4

1985,My Bottom Line: Citrusy connotations dwell within banana pure and biscuity cloves in this sweetish Weizen .

This began a little bit sharply bitter but it improves; overall this IPA seems slightly tired and lackluster , so I suspect this is not a totally fresh can but of course any Ontario beer has to ' represent ' as freshly shelved at the busy LC near me .

The taste is similar to the aroma , but there is the addition of some minerals and lemon . Its tart , salty and refreshing .

2018,"22 oz Bomber Recieved this in a trade from my RB Secret Santa , thanks Melvin . An aggressive pour brought about a fingers worth of tan creamy head that settled to a thick crown . Black body with no light coming throuhg at any point . Leaves patchy lacing here and there . Although the aroma is fairly simple its no less appetizing . there is a light roastiness with a mild nuttiness and mild lactic creaminess . there is also some dark fruit , as it warms , adding a sweetness that compliments the roastiness nicely . There a hint of the nuttiness throught but its faint . Black Sun is medium bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation which at certain times feels a little too prickly . This is a beer I could enjoy all night . Big flavor from a more standard abv stout . The abv really helps the drinkability . Another good beer from Three Floyds . I have always passed this beer up because the pricetag is pretty hefty considering the abv . I am glad I got to give it a shot . Although the price tag is high I would pick a bottle of this up occasionally . This is a solid stout from Three Floyds . The aroma translates pretty well into the flavor . Light roastiness is the canvas with a splash of lactic creaminess here and dark fruit there .

Resiny / piney characteristics of the hops are featured up front . The finish features some of the grapefruit notes promised by the aroma . There is some slight astringency but what truly surprises me for such a bug beer is how completely unnoticeable the alcohol is .

2046,"I poured a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass . Appearance: Opaque black body , forms a rather large , brownish , creamy head . It does dissolve a little quicker than Id prefer , but not completely and leaves decent lacing on the glass . Smell: Big grapefruit and general citrus aroma with an underlying confectionery sweetness . Taste: It seems like everyone is brewing a black IPA these days , some stronger than others , but what separates Uinta Dubhe Imperial Black IPA from the pack is the fact its brewed with hemp seed . This helps to accentuate the earthy / resiny / piney characteristics of the hops . And this certainly is a hop bomb with strong , dank bitterness immediately . As it changes to the second half a sharp , somewhat astringent quality appears momentarily , but then quickly fades away ( I am assuming this is from the hemp seed ) . The finish is mostly the same as the beginning , but with an additional malty sweetness . Its more akin to a porter than a stout , which is a little odd considering how big the beer is . And while the hops certainly are the main attraction here , there is still a noticeable sweetness to the palate . After a few swigs the beginning starts to seem sweeter with dark chocolate and coffee creamer flavors . Maybe a hint of caramel , too , and the aftertaste also has these flavors . Its a very appealing palate and the complete lack of alcohol taste or warmth makes it all the more impressive . Had they left the hemp out it would be a perfect beer as that astringency is a tad distracting , but easily tolerated . Drinkability: you would never know this beer was 9 . 2 % ABV if it were not on the label . It has the body and weight of something half its size . The mouthfeel is soft , full - bodied for sure , but is not sticky and chewy like many imperial IPAs often are . The texture is velvety and creamy and it slides across the tongue and down the throat with ease . The only caveat is the hops do linger , leaving an almost cloying resiny film on the tongue and drying out the mouth . Paired with a robust meal or as a liquid dessert is the best way to drink this beer . ",2012-07-10,uinta-dubhe-imperial-black-ipa,Uinta,4

2049," ( 22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with bkelley 68 , thanks Brian ! ) While Brian Boru spent his entire life fighting and eventually defeating the invading Vikings , I am quite content to let that maurading band from Three Floyds invade my San Diego homeland with their superb beer . And Three Floyds has done it again , bottling yet another winner for us to revel in . Compared to most amber / red ales , this offering is brimming with flavor , so much so that it clearly falls into that semi - official ""double red"" category for me in terms of flavor , yet apparently keeping the alcohol percentage down . Lots of sweet , caramely malts provide a substantial base for this beer , with tea , tropical fruits and moderately bitter hops rounding out this very balanced beer . The fruitiness is especially noticeable on the first few sips , but once the hops get a chance to saturate the palate , the fruitiness tends to get lost in the shuffle . Sweet caramel and tea dominate the nose , but the beer does not smell especially hoppy . No matter , this beer smells great . Medium - full bodied , all corners of my mouth are fully awash in the beers smooth , velvety textures . Deep ruddy amber color shows a bit of haze , and the light tan head pours to almost an inch before slowly settling to a filmy layer . Modest lacing congregates in a few scattered patches about the glass . Just an excellent beer in every way , but honestly , its totally unfair to compare this to other ""regular"" amber ales .

2054,"22 oz bottle at pre - RBSG tasting I brought this along because something compelled me to pick it up at Rileys on a recent trip . Even at $ 2 . 99 it was probably overpriced but unfortunately you cannot return beer just because it seemed like a bad thing to pick ( if you could , there are any number of other beers that I might have done that with ) . This is a malt liquor - you can say what you want about it but the result is the same . The only difference between this and a 40 oz can is that this is ever so slightly more palateable . Aroma / Appearance - What is there to say about something so simple ? Corn forms the base of the aroma which has a bit of an odd funk to it . The clear transparent body hides nothing from sight . Perhaps that is why people drink it out of a brown paper bag . That way you do not have to see what it is you are trying to get down . Flavor / Palate - Corn is the order of the day here . there is no complexity at all though it is suprisingly drinkable . The alcohol is thinly disguised by the pseduo - malts but comes through in the end . All I have to say is that if I were to open this by myself about 12 ounces would be going down the drain .

Big , hoppy aroma that is mostly citrus ( lemon and grapefruit ) , fresh pine , caramel , cereals , whole grains and perhaps a touch of brown sugar . The body is smooth , but not quite full enough to carry the hop bitterness . The flavors are good but not all that amazing . The sweet caramel and malt are given plenty of opportunity to shine before the bitter hops come through . Not as bitter as expected , but the balance is nice .

The smell I am getting is chocolate and roasted malt . The taste on first sip is very chocolaty with good roasted malt flavour and a touch of coffee . Initially , I thought it was going to lean towards the sweet side but the roasted malt bitterness gives it a good dry taste . Further sips in and I can taste *some* smoke but it is lightly done and it really meshes well with the other flavours and makes it quite smooth and quite drinkable . The body is medium , the carbonation is on the light side and the finish , for me , ends on a somewhat semi sweet note . Very nice .

Rich malts , molasses , espresso , fruits , alcohol , chocolate , they are all in there . The flavor is delivered on a medium palate , and it appears thicker than it feels on the tongue .

2125,"From notes on 2012 - 05 - 22 : Vintage 2011 . Cracked this 12 oz bottle after a rough day at work . I am a big fan of opening a favorite brew after a long day . Dark brown body , plenty of tan head . Great retention and lace give AftW top marks for the style . Surprising , since Old Ales are typically ugly . Nose is bursting with bourbon , vanilla , booze , and tons of malt . cannot say its my favorite aroma but certainly enjoyable . Malts and caramelized booze up front; bourbon makes its way in shortly thereafter . Leathery and tobacco - y too . Caramel and vanilla linger after swallowing as the alcoholic warmth soothes my throat . Superb . Huge , viscous body brings everything together . Tons of well - crafted flavors make this immensely enjoyable; AftW is something every beer geek needs to sample . One of my favorites !

The wood is quite prominent and provides some nice tannins and even more vanilla . A bit of bourbon and warmth on the finish .

The color was a nice cloudy orange with a nice two fingers of foamy white head and some slight lacing on the glass . The smell is a nice wheaty flavor . Some solid fruit flavor is making the nose seem nice and light . Some banana and a touch of pear . Some nice malty sweetness is there as well . The taste was a bit more banana and had a good clove flavor that had me thinking of some earthy flavor . The malt is there for a while and it makes this beer a bit sweet then leads into a mild hop finish that stays just sec and then is gone . The feel of this beer is pretty smooth and really enjoyable . It has a way of going down before you really notice it is done . It has just the right amount of aftertaste then let us go like it was not even there .

2135,"750 mL bottle , bottled at Mystic / CBC bottling collab ! Hooray for that ! Fresh and drunk on 10 / 3 / 15 . I feel like CBCs beers are almost always misunderstood and underappreciated and this is no exception . A very lovely , refreshing gruit , I thought . Definitely some acidity , soapiness and plentiful spice , but you just have to accept that when brewing with herbs and other non - malt adjuncts . It definitely is an acquired taste ( or never - acquired taste ) and I certainly see why hops caught on and completely took over . Anyhow , the beer pours a copper color with good clarity and a full off - white head that immediately fizzles away to a ring ( as is the case with most gruits , due to the oils and acids present ) . Heathery - yarrow - like notes in the nose also divulge heavily dry grass , light bits of honey and plentiful floral aromatics . Bits of caramel and toffee , with plenty of minerals and light vanilla . No alcohol or flaw . A mix of bittersweet and even sweet / sour with dry hay , grass , earth and light vanilla that is balanced by sweet toffee and caramel that in turn give way to floral and herbal spice and acidity . Some cidery / apple - like note linger with no alcohol or flaw . Again , though it would be nice to have a creamier , tighter carbonation , I think the herb / hay / honey is to blame for the texture , which is rather watery , with interludes of sticky maltiness . The carbonation is a bit fizzier than Id like as well , but I have yet to see a gruit where this is not the case . Perhaps some wheat would have helped ? Though that would have taken the focus off the hay , so who knows . Nonetheless , I like it and thought it was very successful . ",2015-10-07,cambridge-hay-is-for-horses,Cambridge,4

The aroma is rich with milk chocolate and charcoal . The hops are reserved in this one , but they are there , lurking , giving the burned barley bitterness a little support . it is almost like drinking chocolate milk , this one , it is body thick and smooth with the huge cocoa flavor lingering a touch longer than the rest .

2137,"Bottle . Listed as Au Baron Brasserie ( Gussignies , France ) Cuvee des Jonquilles Biere de Garde ( 7 % ) . Rating is from a practice BJCP Scoresheet . I was scoring it in the biere de garde category ( 16 D ) . The numbers in this rating reflect ratebeers hedonistic scale and not my judging numbers . Aroma: Grassy , toasty , lightly herbal and peppery with some clove notes . A bit musty , candied ginger , toasty malt aromas . Leans a bit more to the spicy yeast character exhibited by saisons . Complex and delicate interaction of yeast and malt with moderate esters . Flavor: Bready , malty , toasty , light musty character with faint esters . Grassy and spicy ( attributable to both the hops and pils malt ) in the finish . Hops character is low as is the bitterness . Lingering balance of fermentation character and malt complexities . Light pear and other fruit notes linger . Nice crispness . Quite dry with a noticeable farmhouse fermentation character . Mouthfeel: Very high and lively carbonation ( nearly harshly so ) , very light warmth . Dry on the finish . Strong carbonic bite . No astringencies . Like a good farmhouse ale it feels refreshing and vibrant . Overall Impression: A very good farmhouse ale that treads the lines between a saison and a biere de garde .

2138,"22 oz bottle . Looks very similar to the regular Yeti , but pours a straight black body with a finger - width , creamy , dark brown head . Dissipates a little quicker than the Yeti , but remains similarly lacy and leaves a swirl on the surface . Aroma is sweet and much more bourbon and woody than the Yeti . Having this back to back with the Yeti , I can definitely tell this was aged in oak barrels . The oak really takes a lot of the bitter and roasty smell away . There is still a good amount of roasted malts , bitter hops , and coffee , but its clearly less evident than the Yeti . Lots of vanilla in this one too . Much more vanilla than chocolate , however , this one has more of a milky chocolate aroma than the Yeti . The taste is noticeably different than the Yeti as well . Much , much , much more oak and bourbon quality . Again , more milky than the Yeti and much more vanilla flavor . Taste is very sweet and rich up front , then balances out quickly to an extremely vanilla , oak , bourbon finish . Less noticeable pine hoppiness than the Yeti , but still a good amount of bitterness . Less roasty as well , but again , its still there . Full bodied , still extremely velvety smooth , and a dry , moderate finish . The finish is , however , much more vanilla and bourbon flavored than the Yeti . It also seems to be lighter on the bitter lingering flavor . The flavor still lingers , but instead of the roasty bitterness in the Yetis finish , this is more vanilla and bourbon . Overall , I love this beer . I adore the oak and bourbon quality , but I think I may like the regular Yeti a little better . This one has less chocolate , coffee , and roasted qualities than the Yeti . which I tend to enjoy more in an imperial stout . and more of a boozy character . which I still love .

She pours a mostly dark brown and leaves the same colored body with less than a fingers worth of slightly foamy head that dies within a minute , some slightly clingy lacing mainly slides into the body . The smell has tart cherries up front , slight hints of oakiness . The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma adds a fairly extreme sour element invading my taste buds . There is a tart cherry aftertaste , and somewhat of a dry finish . On the palate , she sits about a medium , and comes across fairly sessionable - perhaps . Carbonation pounds my mouth and tongue , but honestly I am not sure how this compares to others of its style , good I guess . Overall , I know this is my first Flanders Red ale for review on here , so uh . sure , Ill say good for the style but for me , its extremely tart and sour , Ill have to look into more of this style to see how they compare if I seek any more at all .

There is something quite attractively compelling about the brute strength of this beer . Something roughish and intriguing . Sweet and , yes , pleasant . It could be earthier .

2180,"A very unique experience . I had no idea what I was in for when I started to try these various years and foils . It was most memorable . To begin , I was first given a sample of 2003 silver foil . Poured a deep brown with brick red hints . Very dark and opaque . The aroma was tart with deep fruit ( I noted plum and fermented grapes ) . The flavor was sour and tart . Very crisp with lots of fruit ( lemon , peach , and grapes ) . A veritable fruit cocktail . The body , as I have stated , was quite crisp . This is the one I rated at 4 . 1 . Next up was the 2004 Silver . This one poured a bit hazier and more brick red than the previous year . The aroma had some chalky tartness , and a swear I smelled some brine hiding in there . The flavor of this was even more intensely sour and tart than the 2003 ( not surprising I guess ) . Again , I noted many fruit flavors . This time I noted Lemon , pear and grape . Full of fruit . The body was light and crisp . Jen said it was deliciously fruity . Full of berries , white peach , nectarine , and green fruit . Lastly she noted a hint of cherry . I only rated this at about a 3 . 9 , though my wife would likely have given it another 4 - 4 . 1 at least . I should have rated the gold foil but I was too far gone . Maybe some day .

The look: Partly cloudy redish - amber body topped by a very small off - white head In long: No need for description here , we all know and love the regular Rodenbach products . This one has a body as thin as the regular Rodenbach . Sourness level is in between regular Rodenbach and the Grand Cru .

Feels much sweeter than other Rodenbach products . Lacks the cherries and tannins of the Grand Cru , here it is more sweetened dark grapes and other fruits . A lot less tasty than Grand Cru . If you expect a Rodenbach Grand Cru quality or something standout from this special Rodenbach release you are in for a major disappointment . But if JoBlo Brewing Company was to bottle something like this Id say this is a pretty damn good beer and that is a pretty dumb brewery name . ",2010-02-08,rodenbach-vintage,Rodenbach,4

2227,"2005 vintage: Pristine yellow gold . White head nosily fizzles as it slowly diminishes into a consistent , well - retained collar . Zingy , saliva - inducing aromas of unripe peaches , grass , melon , leather , bandage , dried apples , and musty basement . Notably minerally as well . Hints of iron and cedar . Soft , big - bubbled crackle of carbonation . Soft , well - rounded lactobacillus tartness immediately fuses with a bright kiss of explosive fruit which packs supple weight and a high concentration of refined sweetness . Notes of leather and oak gorgeously contrast with the slick body and remarkably succulent apple character as they lend light grip . Complexity is through the roof , and the balance is awe - inspiring . Brett - derived phenols crisply sparkle with pinpoint definition which echoes the equally snappy apple profile . Perfumey esters enhance the lift and bolster the quaffable nature of the cider . Borderline - brisk acidity lightly buckles the cheeks as it lends slight firmness to the otherwise resoundingly juicy body . Faint apple skin bitterness complements the structure as it harmonizes with the poignant yet artfully understated oak character . Tannins are nonexistent which allows the fruit to showcase its pureness . Acid continually teases the palate as it wavers in and out of the dense residuals . Lovely interplay between dryness and sweetness as it finishes with a lengthy fusion of pineapple , peach , musty cellar , and vibrant apples . Both a rustic and extravagant cider from Frances finest . Not stocking this by the case should be a sin . This is divine .

2277,"Stickee Monkee 15 vintage The beer pours a hazelnut brown color , with brighter ember hints in it . Yields a small , fizzy head , which will not rebuild after excessive swirling . The nose offers a tremendous amount of Bourbon soaked oak , spicy , warm , full of coconut and earth mingled vanilla . This gets coated up by rock sugar , toffee and caramel , exhibiting a profound sweetness , gently balanced by the multi layered barrel . The nose finds an additional layer in roasted , warm nutshells , licorice and wild honey . Drinks with just the required amount of carbonation , subtle , yet well accentuated , preventing the beer from sticking to the tongue , keeps it going with a lot of nuances becoming detectable on the palate . Provides a silk , not overly thick body , ensuring the sugar rush to maintain enjoyable . Tastes of earth coated , melting toffee , a subtle spiciness , more earth and a nice roast quality , enriching the malts . As the Bourbon gets introduced to the palate , more spices unfold , entangled into rock sugar and a pleasant , slick coffee dryness . While this produces a rich sweetness , it does by no means overpower the beers overall taste profile , tamed and enriched by the well pronounced Bourbon . Finishes with a noteable bite within the otherwise complete silk mouthfeel , representing a warming , still enjoyably balanced Bourbon peak . A dry spice bitterness represents the introduction to the beers finish , with rock sugar and melted toffee remaining detectable , showcasing a clean , yet appealing ending . This may be the most complex , well nuanced sweet beer I have ever had . At first , I have been disappointed by its thinner mouthfeel , then I started to undertand its benefits . The palate reacts more sensitive to peppery Bourbon , the utmost silk mouthfeel and changes within the malt sweetness , without becoming sticky or cloying . Nontheless , this is still a sipper , a pleasant one though . ",2016-02-16,firestone-walker-stickee-monkee,Firestone Walker,4

The flavor follows suit , striking a nice balance between sweet chocolate and dark , figgy fruit and staunchly bitter , earthy hops and spice . The body is on the light side , balanced in carbonation and entirely quaffable . Plenty of taste here . Great little session schwarz , though this will undoubtedly drop off and become muddled very quickly . Freshness is the key here . Original rating . Unlabeled , experimental bottle , courtesy TheCheeseMan . Pours a translucent , light chestnut brown color with a minimal , swirly , off - white head and virtually no lacing .

The beer is a pale amber tinged , tan color that shows a brilliantly clear , bright golden hue when held up to the light . The aroma smells amply of fruit , with pear , and floral apple leading the way , but there is a noticeable backdrop of earthy spice aromatics that suggest at coriander , woody ginger , perhaps a hint of menthol somehow , and an earthy pepper note that seems to have lost its heat but still has a woody edge to it . Prickly carbonation up front significantly accentuates a peppery spice character that is in this beer . As the beer rolls across the tongue , solid fruit laden pear flavors , touches of floral apple , and some tangy green grape flavors are all noticeable . The peppery notes lead the spice character here , but there is a woody character , some ginger like notes , as well as a significant clove character that grows and lingers towards the finish of each sip . The beer has a body that is fairly light , definitely light for a typical beer of this strength , but it still has a definite viscosity to it , but that does not keep this from being dangerously quaffable .

The carbonation , attack and bitterness are very sharp , the beer is actually quite intense in its own way . The hops have a strong spicy nature , so much so that it almost turn this otherwise highly drinkable beer into a sipper . Somewhat similar to a Taras Boulba but this Boskeun has a sweeter sugary body and the extreme spicy nature of the hops ( white pepper ) is a bit too much . Still , this is truly a kick - ass beer .

Munich malt flavors and compliments the chocolate and espresso blend . Cherry - wood smoked malt is imbued upon the maltiness and coffee profile . Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and Munich malt combination . Magnum , Perle , Centennial , and Cascade hops bring a fair bitterness to the complexion . The alcohol content burns the take and lingers into the finish . Perle and Centennial hops are discerned on the take . Magnum and Cascade are distinguished during the chocolate and caramel finish . Oat malt textures the chocolate and vanilla frame . Porter Baltique is a glamorous dark lager . Chocolate , Munich malt , espresso , vanilla , and caramel mix into an incredible porter sensation . The Perle hops and alcohol burn take is amazing to the chocolate body . The oatmeal , vanilla , and Munich malt glistens the mouthfeel .

2424,"Considering that this is a Belgian Strong Ale , the Duvel most certainly looks like a pale lager; light and yellow with a sizable , dense foamy head . Even smells of pale malts and hops; also very lager - like except for some underlying yeast notes . Upon the first sip , however , the impression turns around completely: this is no pale lager . Yeasty , grassy and rather dry , with a bitter hop finish gently masked in some sweet undercurrents . Some booze to go as well . It could have been the big bad brother of a pale lager though , except for the strong yeast notes , but on further tasting its actually more similar to a tripel . The prominent fermentation taste , the dryness and the floral , grassy notes sticking out here and there . All very tripel - ish , and if somebody rebottled Duvel and sold it as a new kind of tripel , I for one would not be able to tell the difference - which again shows the difficulties of style definitions . Nice stuff though , and a Belgian classic . ",2010-03-25,duvel,Duvel Moortgat,3
2425,"At first pour , brilliant pale gold with large rocky head . The aroma hits you with fruity citrus and slightly sweet hint of clove . The head remains persistant and clings to the side of the glass to the last drop . The flavor favors the malt and yeast with the hops on the finish alongside the alcohol warmth . On the palate , crisp , bracing Champagne - like Co 2 bite . This is a great accompaniment with moules and pomme frites . ",2010-02-27,duvel,Duvel Moortgat,4
2426,"Bottle , thanks Shaun . Poured into the brewers stemware . Natural hazy golden pour with a medium sized fine bubbled white head with lots of lace . Super clean and tart nose , wine barrel comes through but harmonizes so naturally with the base beer that you would think it was always meant to be there . Light honey , lemon , oak . Fantasticly integrated flavor as well and not as wine dominant as some of HFB other wine barrel aged beers . Slightly slick and acidic palate , could stand for a touch more crispness but I am not sure if that is really a legitimate critique . But this is a damn fine beer . Shit , I am really having trouble finding a way to take points away from this beer and its everything I want in a saison plus more . This sorta reminds me of Shauns Saison Lambic Pinot Noir that he brewed in Denmark for the Norreboro brewery with the os that have lines going through them possibly diagonally but this is better . I can honestly say that Id rather be home here in NC drinking this awesome beer than to be in LA right now drinking copious amounts of awesome shit with my homies . Because this is that good and I have it all to myself . Sometimes , you have to be selfish . ",2012-07-20,hill-farmstead-ann,Hill Farmstead,5
2427,"Calling this a great pilsener is like saying how great Kentucky is because Cincinnati is such a nice city - it has appeal because it crosses over to different territory . Full marks for appearance - have I ever said that for a pilsener ? - nice cascade , hazy off - yellow , and wonderful mass of whipped egg - white - like head . The aroma and flavor emit masses of quality hops , giving a floral but at times Juicy Fruit - brand chewing gum flavor . Here is where my mind was thinking ""IPA"" ? ""American pale ale ? "" So distinctively hoppy , it was enjoyable except for , to me , an overly sharp bitterness hanging on . I am not a hopaholic , so this did not strike my fancy as much . Sort of like being in Cincinnati ( when I would rather be in Kentucky , or better yet , New York ) . Still , very enjoyable , very drinkable , very interesting .

2428,"Bottle from brewery webshop , bottled Sept . ' 19 , bought in ' 20 and drunk august ' 21 . Hazy dark - brown pour with small beige head; limited retention . Aroma is rich and complex: both red fruit ( currant ) and dry fruit ( raisin , fig ) , bit soury , but also somewhat spicy , and clear rum . The souryness is stronger in the taste , earlier fruity than lacto; maybe even a bit too much , because it overflows the sweetness of rum and caramel in the aftertaste . Soft carbo , bit flat mouthfeel; the rum brings an alcoholic element , without being boozy . Interesting brew; maybe a bit out of balance to me , towards the sour / lacto , but still lots to smell and taste . ",2021-08-27,jopen-koyt-ba-tres-hombres-rum,Jopen,4

2430,"Magnum shared by Adam C on 7 / 25 / 15 . Deep , dark , porter - colored liquid ( just coined that term ) is of indeterminable clarity , though assumedly pretty clear , as Shawns non - IPAs usually drop bright . Tan head is good - sized and well - retained . We had a pretty good discussion about barrel aging while we were all drinking this guy and my position was of this being right on the border of my tolerance ( for bourbon apparency ) . On one hand , the bourbon notes are not harsh / boozey and the barrel itself is not heavily tannic , but its still quite dominant overall , pushing out a lot of potential beer character in the nose . Spicy bourbon , dry coconut and sweet vanilla are all prominent . Roast takes a backseat , but enough maltiness helps keep it balanced ( balanced in the sweet vs . dry sense , not balanced in the bourbon vs . beer character sense ) . With warming , I did get a bit of fusel / glue - like heat . Full , soft , luxurious body is definitely a strong point here . The milk chocolate - like flavors of Everett are here dried out by the barrel , producing a more reserved , dark chocolate - like character replete with vanilla from both barrel and malt . Spicy bourbon washes over the palate , as well , and char and coconut are felt , helping to balance the big malt profile . Pleasant enough bourbon flavor and again its not sharp or raw ( though there is a touch of heat here , for sure ) , but I just think its a bit too heavy - handed , overall , on the bourbon character . Would prefer significantly less , or better yet , none ! Why change Everett , its nearly a perfect porter ! ",2015-08-05,hill-farmstead-everett-bourbon-barrel-aged-2014-,Hill Farmstead,4

The beer is black . Aroma is the expected coffee , with some chocolate , and maybe a bit of black licorice . This beer is like candy . It is definitely thick - somewhat reminiscent of chocolate syrup , between the palate and the flavor . But the bitterness actually dampens the palate effect a bit . Finish is dark chocolate bitter - in the 100 % cacao sense . Alcohol shows a bit at times , but mostly masked well . Long finish has a touch of earth / dirt .

Instead hints of vanilla come through with a stronger aroma of cinnamon and other spices . Of course the pumpkin is there too . My initial thoughts of this beer totally changed though when I took the first sip . It was a total bourbon bomb . Alcohol warmed my throat all the way down to my stomach . The alcohol and bourbon had washed away everything else that was in the smell . The good thing though is that the next sips and the finishing ones were totally different . Its like the beer wants the bourbon to totally take your taste buds at first but then let in all the other stuff . The bourbon was still their , its not going away , but the spices come through more and more as you drink . Cinnamon and nutmeg . The vanilla lingers on the tongue and the pumpkin comes through nicely on the after taste . The mouthfeel is smooth and oily . Medium bodied .

It was if time stood still . While holding my breath , I waited for the shattering of glass . No glass . Whew , did I dodge a bullet . Then I hear the pssst of a leaking cap . Oh crap , what beer did I knock off . Of course it had to be this one . At least I did not shatter the bottle and it was drinkable ! I have been in the mood for a Flemish Sour anyway . Poured a deeper and cloudy reddish / brown color with a large ( could it be because it fell 3 ft ) tan head . Aromas of sour cherries , oak , very light vanilla , and light yeast .

Flavor is dry oats and dark chocolate overridden by deep roasted coffee . Not pulling any surprises but pulls everything together oh so well . Creamy at first , then transitions to a waxy resonance on the palate . Heavy hopping leads strongly to bitterness , but heaps of roasted and chocolate malts help to balance it .

Roasty , cocoa - malt in the aroma along with some surprisingly strong yeast and a bit of alcohol .

Flavor possesses far more subtlety than I had imagined . Hops are here towards the finish , but do not contribute enough bitterness to distract from the expertly blended malt flavors . Hops do lend a nice spicy note , however . Sweetness becomes more evident in the aftertaste , and as the beer warms . Served at 55 - 60 F , as suggested by the bottle itself .

2525,"Bottle from Best Damn Beer Shop: Poured a glowing white / yellow hue that hazy and was topped by a thick lather of foamy head that eventually fizzes out . My nose detects a sour and spicy strain of Belgian yeast that reminds me of Flemish sour ale , but there is also a scent of coriander and a strong aroma of wine too . The flavor is tart with a heaping dosage of spicy Belgian yeast and Chardonnay wine . There are plenty of spices such as coriander , pepper , lime leaf , grains of paradise and etc . however , I do not taste the most typical Belgian white beer flavor which is orange peel . Certainly , much stronger in spices than was expected and the French Oak Chardonnay over compensates by creating a monster witbier , but I was not taken back by this recipe .

2528,"Pours a slightly hazy , pale golden yellow color with visible carbonation bubbling up and a two finger frothy , pillowy white head that slowly settles into a thick cap / ring . Large streaks and chunks of soapy lacing are left behind . Earthy aroma with lots of zesty spice along with some musty , bretty funk and vinous light fruit . Lots of peppery spice , lemon zest and coriander followed by bready yeast , musty brett and light fruits . The barrel presence is there but the Chardonnay is more prominent in the nose than the oak giving off hints of grape , cider and pear . Medium bodied with soft carbonation and crisp effervescence up front that linger over the slightly funky , sweet vinous body into a slight dry finish . there is a good amount of zesty spice , bready yeast and light fruit but the flavor is dominated by the Chardonnay barrel character . The spice profile has hints of pepper and coriander as well as a boatload of citrusy lemon zest that is complimented by the dry brett . The Brett provides some nice dryness and faint funk but does not overpower the other notes . The barrel presence kicks in mid - palate and really dominates the flavor through the finish . there is only subtle toasted oak adding to the dryness but the Chardonnay character is very prominent giving off sweet vinous notes that balances things out . Lots of sweet fruit notes , especially light grapes , apple cider and pear . I would even say that its a bit too strong taking away slightly from the other elements . Still , this beer is flavorful , very complex and easy to drink . Overall this beer could use some balance to counter the Chardonnay sweetness but is still pretty impressive . Another solid offering from this up and coming brewery . ",2011-11-10 00:00:00,anchorage-whiteout-wit-bier,Anchorage,4

Though the sediment in the beer is a lot more defined then in the non - Grand Cru version everything else is there initially that you would expect . The taste is not on par of the normal version though and the palate leaves you wanting more with a more lively carbonation but more of an oily / sticky feel to the beer in total . Overall , you have initially what makes a Blue Moon very popular except that instead of excelling with those points you start detracting from them with the rest of the beer which makes it less enjoyable in the long run . Yes it has more alcohol then a normal Blue Moon , and yes you will get drunk quicker if that is what you are looking for .

There is a pretty high level of carbonation , so this beer feels light and airy on the palate , not unlike Champagne . Truth be told , the alochol level is really well - hidden .

2536,"Transfer from BA review on 2 - 10 - 13 - Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance - Pours a nice clear golden amber color with hints of orange within and tons of carbonation bubbles rushing up through the body of the brew . Upon pouring there is a one finger white head that fades relatively quickly leaving only a tiny amount of lacing . Smell - The aroma is quite sweet in nature consisting largely of a caramel smell . Beyond this aroma there is a very light corn smell as well as some light notes of orange . Taste The taste begins bready and sweet with flavors of citrus mixed within . The bready flavors are a mix of wheat bread and malt with the sweet being a blend of orange and caramel . The flavors of the brew remain relatively consistent throughout the taste with the caramel fading a bit and more citrus taking its place . In the end a sweeter malty and citrus flavor are left to linger on the tongue . Mouthfeel The body of the beer is quite light in its creaminess with a carbonation level that is average to just above . The carbonation and thinner body are quite nice for the largely sweeter flavors of the brew and suit it quite well to make for an easy drinking beer . Overall A rather refreshing , but maybe a little too sweet brew . If you are looking for something rather smooth and crisp with a moderate citrus and malt taste and a good deal of sweetness then this is a good choice .

Now that I had found notes on this during a party I was at and I sat there and did not want to bother with anyone , here is my take on this beer . The night I actually reviewed this , this was poured into a pint glass . Please do not ask me how else I have had this beer over the years . The appearance was a total see through golden yellow with rapidly rising bubbly carbonation pouring into the rapidly dissipating head that is actually only less than a half a fingers worth of head . The smell was cooked rice with toasted corn notes to it . Do I like this ? Hmmm . well , its not exactly my cup of tea . The taste was mainly sweet through the cooked rice and corn notes . There is a slight sweet aftertaste and no finish . On the palate , this is exceptionally light . Sessionable - this defines it . The carbonation seems to fairly good for the style as there is nothing bad about it . Overall , well , I see its labeled a pale lager on Ratebeer . However , I am not really seeing it as a pale lager as its more of a light lager . Ever since I took my plunge into the world of craft beer , I have not had this since .

2621,"Part 1 of vertical ( Next to the Hallertau and baseline Lat 48 ) : As expected all three beers have pretty much identical appearances with just slightly more head on the Hallertau . ""Nice deep golden hue with a big frothy slightly off - white head and streams of lacework . "" Aroma of the Hallertau is a tad more spicy , resiny and leafy than the EKG which is more herbal and grassy . When compared to the base Lat 48 , I actually like the nose of the single noble hopped beers more ( not as dank nor fusel in nature ) . Both single hopped brews get a 8 score while the base got dropped to a 7 . It is one the palate where these two single hopped beers go different directions . The EKG is so smooth and mellow with light fruitiness , grassy and earthy tones versus the Hallertau which displays a more robust resiny leafy and ""raw"" character . I prefer the smoothness of the EKG and its ability to let the malt shine as well . The EKG while not as clean as the Hallertau seems a bit more complex . Hallertau gets a 7 , EKG a 8 , base was a 6 . The mouth feel is equally lively and crisp in all three beers , what sets them apart is the Hallertau cleaner finish . Overall I liked both of these noble hopped versions better than the 5 hop base beer . I feel the malt bill allows these hops to show what they do best . It pains me to say this but the Hallertau won this battle even though I still love the EKG hop more in my homebrew applications .

Those ""winter spices"" are first up on the tongue , and do give this a bit of wassail character . there is a mild fruit tartness after that that seems ""juicier , "" more the pomegranate , then a bit of orange . The mouthfeel is pretty thin , like one usually gets for a shandy . I think mixing ones own with a ""substantive"" juice like a pulpy lemonade or OJ might help this style . But still , this is a project company that is staking its claim to the shandy category , and I cannot fault them for trying to make a winter seasonal version .

The aroma picked up semi - sweet strawberries , cream , and a little vanilla . fresh berry seeds right on the back of the nose . no complaints . The flavor found dank , tacky strawberry seeds throughout . light pale and biscuity malt supported . finished with sharp seeds and a touch of lemon zest . I did not enjoy the way this moved through the mouth . Lighter - bodied , tart , and scratchy on the palate . drinkable , but not very enjoyable .

The blackberry is over the top and really comes across like cough syrup . On taste , there is mostly just more of that artificial and sweet blackberry fruit note .

4817,"Pours a hazy , dark orange coloration with a small , fluffy head . Smells is a little subdued , with some biscuity malt and faint citrus , tropical and berry notes of lime peel , mango and white grape coming through . Taste is an excellent balance of biscuity malt and juicy , fruity , slightly spicy and resinous hops , with citrus . tropical and berry notes of grapefruit , lime peel , mango , papaya , white grape and gooseberry , as well as just a hint of black pepper and pine . Finishes with a light bitterness and some lime peel , mango , white grape and pine lingering in the aftertaste . Soft , pillowy mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation . While this makes for a very enjoyable New England IPA , I honestly cannot say that it blew me away compared to some of the better NEIPAs I have had from Europe , ultimately proving to me that the hyped US breweries are just ""cooking with water"" ( a German saying ) , or rather brewing with water , hops , malt and yeast like everybody else . While you cannot really hold this against the beer , I am certainly not paying 9 ( relatively cheap ) for a can like this ever again . The NZ hops , which I love , are certainly coming through here very nicely , with some juicy and vibrant citrus and berry notes , as well as lighter tropical notes and just a hint of spicy , resinous accents to keep things interesting , while the mouthfeel is particularly nice and fluffy , although the aroma is honestly a little disappointing .

This was poured into a snifter , uh . ok , I guess I am not going to argue but its just a fruit beer , well here is the rest . The appearance was a nice hazy dark brown close to light purple tinges along the sides of the glass . there is a decent light sliding lacing trickling down the sides of the glass . The smell had the blueberry obviously up front . It comes in fairly hard with a nice drive of some light malts to back it all up . The taste was mainly sweet through the blueberry and the malts . It leaves a decent sweet sticky blueberry aftertaste and a super refreshing finish . On the palate , this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it . The carbonation was mainly subdued and let us the blueberry just coat my mouth and tongue . Overall , this was a pretty good beer to have as a dessert on late Summer in the evening .

Watery , vague , loose carbonation does nothing to counteract the massively thin , undermalted body . I am no fan of big , malty , full - textured beers but this needs ALOT more body .

Nose is apple , pear , citrus , and after a bit oak and cognac . More muddled and heavy than the lower ABV Cantillon offerings . Taste is a lot of oak , cognac , wine , apple , pear and citrus . More like a wooded fume blanc with the amount of oak and fruit . Very vinous character . Feel is much more about the barrel . Oaked fruit , slightly heavy and a lot less carbonation than others . Nice but possible too heavy and not as lifted . Fun to try but was a bit meh about it",2013-10-20,cantillon-50%C2%B0n-4%C2%B0e-2003-2007-2012-2015-2020-cognac,Cantillon,3

TECHNICAL: Bottle . Poured a medium sparkling , amber with a small white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing . The aroma was mostly ruby - red grapefruit as was the flavor with a short to average finish .

Very aromatic , spruce , lemon zest , flowers , lime , hemp , peach , pineapple , soap , very close to the regular one but more aromatic still and a bit more lush and exotic . Same for the flavour: it has the same clean but lively fruitiness in onset , perhaps a bit more pineapple flavour but difficult to say , same degree of carbonation ( fizzy but not too much ) , same light bready malt profile , but a more complex , more outspoken and more bittering hoppiness , with a bit more earthiness and yeastiness in the finish . This one has a tad more grapefruit hoppiness and more fragrance , but I cannot say this automatically makes it better than the regular Congress Street: to me , both are on a par as being very elegant , refined , fragrant IPAs of world class quality .

I am actually NOT going to rate this to style , because if I did my score would be much lower and that would be unfair to a very tasty brew . While this does retain certain characteristics of an Alt beer , it is definitely not a purebred Alt beer in my opinion . If you were to serve this to someone in a blind taste test , not in a million years would they identify it as an Alt . Due to the strong hoppy notes , it is much closer to a Pale Ale or even an Amber Ale in my mind , which is not a bad thing at all .

Poured a clear , medium to dark , reddish amber with a large to huge , foamy , off - white head that slowly diminished , but kept a nice sheet and left good lacing . The aroma was light to moderate grain , roasted malt , nutty malt and caramel; light to almost moderate , grassy hops; vegetable , ever so slight hint of vinegar , hints of tobacco , hints of cherry and slight candy . The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet , slightly acidic and slightly acetic; while the finish was sweet , light to moderately bitter , slightly acidic and lightly sour with an average duration . There was caramel malt , toasted and nutty malts , tart cherries , a little burnt malt , light to moderate hops and some grain .

The melon and light citrus flavors are a great fit for the style , if not quite balanced spot on here .

The pour was a murky dark brown with a slight mahogany hue and a thick frothy light brown head that dissipated slowly down to a layer of fluffy residue that puddled on top and lasted throughout , which created some really excellent sheeting of lace on the glass . The aroma was upfront with a strong alcohol scent followed by a dark roasted malt and a sweaty doughy yeast with notes of chocolate , vanilla , roasted coffee , some dark fruit and a peppery spice ( probably from the chilis ) . The taste was mildly sweet and very malty with hints of chocolate and vanilla at first and then had a nice dose of coffee and dark fruit take hold with a pronounced peppery finish . The flavor lasted a short while after the swallow leaving behind a chili pepper bite to linger on well after everything else faded .

6438,"Not bad . Hops forward but goes down smooth like a lager . I think I am beginning to understand this Imperial Pale Lager style a little bit better . So many of them are just watered down IPAs brewed like lagers and its like ""Congratulations on your Pilsner or your malt - light Vienna lager . Good luck with your stupid marketing ploy"" . This has enough hops that you can kind of picture it as its own thing , but yet does not really have the body and the taste profile Id associate with an IPA . I am still not persuaded that this is a really a style , but if I were to make the case that it was , this would be the beer Id use to make it ( Kudos to Rate Beer for classifying it correctly as an Imperial Pilsner , by the way ) . Id rather Sierra Nevada have brought back its ESB , the spring seasonal they had in the days of yore , but this is okay . I think its be a hit at a party where you have got some craft beer drinkers and some macro drinkers and want a good crossover beer that everyone is satisfied with . Ill drink the other 11 . I might buy again if on sale before summer , but probably not at full price - its good , but its very by the numbers in some respects . This is a 7 % ABV that tastes like a 4 % ABV , so watch out if you are drinking multiples .

Overall: Its refreshing , clean beer . Pretty empty at this point at time , I get that almost 6 months since packing past , but there is more than 6 months still to go before ""best before"" date .

6448,"In short: A New Glarus Belgian Red with roasted malts . Very good . How: Bottle 12 oz . Age unknown . Sent to me by brewolf . Thanks a lot Michael The look: Clear dark ruby body topped by a persistent small beige head In long: Nose of sweet maraschino cherries . I did not smell a stout here . It basically smells like a less intense version of New Glarus own Belgian Red . Taste is burnt toasts , maraschino cherries , wood , generic black cake , light chocolaty notes . Finish has a surprising bitterness , similar to bitter cherries . All in all this is more a fruit beer than a stout . The cherries are really the dominant flavor . Not quite as good as a Belgian Red but still pretty damn good . I really like this beer although I am certain that this is just a stout blended with their Belgian Red . And do not try to prove me wrong . I am such a smart ass that my butt has a PhD . ",2010-11-18 00:00:00,new-glarus-thumbprint-series-cherry-stout,New Glarus,3.8

6459,"First impression was ""hmm , I know these lager hops"" . Pours pale amber , a bit unclear due to hops sediments , with white - ish frothy top , not huge but persistent . Aroma - medium intensity , herbal , rough hops with hints of pine , kind of tropical fruits , a bit greipfruit . Later aroma becames more malty , I cought some barbery notes . But still Magnum dominates in this brew as in aroma as in flavor - kind of masterpiece because flavor and aroma are pleasant . Taste medium bitter and medium sweet . Palate - medium to full body , thick texture , seems average carbonation ( spongee texture a bit ) , with light dry finish . Some sweetness in aftertaste sticks to . Nice pale ale , like the usage of Mgm , dislike - too many empty advertisment . ",2015-02-11 00:00:00,sierra-nevada-pale-ale-bottle-can,Sierra Nevada,3.4

Another good pumpkin beer ! that is two this year ! I think this one might be just slightly better than the Sam Adams - a little more pumpkin pie - ish - even though the sweetness might be a bit much if one were to have more than one .

6468,"Sierra Nevada has graced us with not one but two new beers this year , although getting my hands on , much less keeping their Torpedo IIPA in stock is proving to be a feat of magic and miracles . On the other hand , their Kellerweisse Hefeweizen is much easier to find and just as delicious to sup . While I laud the Torpedo for its exuberant yummyness , I also chastise it for its lack of availability . that is alright though; it is a temporary issue which will eventually be resolved . Hopefully . In the meantime , I am going to sup on many a 6 pack of Kellerweisse Hefeweizen . Sierra Nevada finally got a wheat beer right . Even better , its a bottle - conditioned Hefeweizen which guarantees a longer shelf life and some maturation with age . Clouds of orangesicle , yellow cream , and white marshmallow puffs fill my glass with rich beauty; truly a work of art . Her white head floats suspended , lazing about with nonchalant lessez - faire while I make sure to swirl the bottle dregs into my glass . The dregs WILL be mine ! As I pour the last of her luscious chunky bits into my glass , a billowing bouquet of bananas , banana cream , banana bread warm from the oven with nuts aromatizing the air while spices and clove tease my senses . Amazingly smooth , creamy , and bursting with all the hefeweizen esters I love so much . A touch of toasted meringue and I am on to quaffing bliss . Just as her nose promised , the mouthfeel is also smooth , creamy , and boldly going where many beers before her have gone . Gliding over my tastebuds , banana cream lays next to banana pudding while I slice into a huge chunk of warm banana nut bread exuding cinnamon , nutmeg , and clove . Real butter is really good so of course I slather a generous amount over my banana bread which melts into the Kellerweisse Hefeweizens gorgeous palate . My breath is warm with clove and spice while toasted nuts lightly dry my palate just in time for another generous quaff . She is gentle as silk , belying her lightly chewy mouthfeel . As she grows just a touch drier , the palate evolves from banana bread warm from the oven to dry banana bread mix . Exquisite balance . Each quaff is traced by beautifully creamy lace and far sooner than expected , my glass is empty . Good thing I have more in my fridge because I feel a second coming . German Hefeweizens are a love - hate relationship for many . I , of course , fall amongst the love them camp . Great year round , they especially shine in the warmer muggy months where the sun shows no mercy and the skies are an endless deep blue sea . Excellent job , Sierra Nevada . A true German - style Hefeweizen , she is a proud new addition to a long established family of good beers . ",2009-08-09 00:00:00,sierra-nevada-kellerweis-hefeweizen,Sierra Nevada,3.9

6476,"Rating # 200 with the brewery that started me on the path to drinking good beer many years ago . A lovely brown with a red hue on the appearance leads into a delightful combination of cherry and chocolate on the nose . On the palate , it reminded me of a Belgian Red more than a stout when warm , and more stouty when cold . The flavors are exceptional . The sour Door County cherries win the day for me . I used to eat these all the time in my WI days , and sampling them again in a stout beer was refreshing . Lots of vanilla and cinammon here as well , and a wonderful , long lasting finish .

Its like rating my grandfather: praise is obvious , criticism betrays ingratitude . I will say that its obviously unfiltered appearance is always welcome in the glass , and its pleasantly bitter flavor remains pleasant despite the many beers that have surpassed it in the hops arms race of the last decade . This exudes a robust yeasty aroma that , when combined with its mild ( but still present ) flavor and body , makes it the perfect session or poolside companion .

FLAVOR / PALATE Creamy honey poured over fresh slices of melon cool the tongue and throat . Traces of a mead flirt with essences of apricot and sweet fruit .

6583,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 24 oz bottle into a pint glass . The label reads 12 th release 2008 . Appearance: The head builds up tall , thick and firm from the slow pour . . It is light tan in color and has excellent retention . A nice small cap of foam hangs on until the last sip and as it slowly slides its way down the glass it makes lots of cool lacing that sticks to the glass . Under the head lies a beautiful deep amber colored body with just the slightest protein or chill haze . Smell: The aroma has a piney resin like hop character with some citrus notes as well . Under that are some light bready / malty notes with just a hint of estery / yeasty red apple skin notes as well as a touch of raw grain . Taste / Palate: Like the Southern Hemisphere Harvest , this Harvest has a good sturdy base of bready malt sweetness with a touch raw grain . Hop flavor is also quit firm and assertive . The hop character is that of tasty piney hops with some resiny and juicy lemony / grapefruit citrus notes . The bitterness from the hops is more than equal to the malt sweetness and lasts well into the finish . The palate has a nice solid medium feel with plenty of lively carbonation .

The unusual thing about this brew is that the malts and hops just blend together never does one overwhelm the other . This is an amazingly balanced beer .

It may not be as advanced as some of its Strong Belgian Ale cousins found in the higher price refrigerator , but it has the same basic taste and it appeals to a broader audience . Its not quite a working mans beer , but the Abbey has a dusky , lowdown feel while keeping a high brow aura . It pours a dark auburn , with a fantastic off - white head . The foam is thick and looks welcoming to an eager lip . The beer feels very muscular as well and full on the first sip before fully developing its flavor . As per the tradition of Belgian ales there is a lot of fruit to be found , but mostly apple . The Abbey also seemed sweeter than other Belgian ales I have had .

A little intrigued by the new process; have not read anything about it , but it does make sense in the head . Nose is very woody , piny , with grapefruit zest and peel , resin , orange , Citra - like citrus and juice; pours clear but rich golden and a sudsy beige head . Taste is strongly bitter , shocks the mouth like raw pith but without astringency; nice to taste something that bitter , its been a while since the big boys started to tone down for sessions . Pretty dry , but shy of bone; juicy with smooth resin and very faint caramel , a little more pine ( but really no spice ) , and medium - full body with a bit of heft but no alcohol slap . Good hearty character to the malt , too . A firm , strong IPA like they used to be made , and one that really backs up its 60 BU; I cannot make out much of a difference in aromatics at this point ( and temperature ) , but its a good one through and through , great hop soul .

Deepest garnet hue , the topping is dark beige , reducing quickly , but leaving a good sheet of foam . A hefty dose of various dark , nutty , roasty and chocolatey malts wears a grilled almond dominance . Minimal charcoal hints . Expressive earthy , woody hops make for a great blending with the roast , the little acidity that there is to it avoids to be overly citric and while it has a certain lactic aspect to it , it is layered within the chocolate maltiness to give the impression of a chocolate milk more than a roast / acid combat . Decent lenght keeps the roast and ashey malt vs . woody hops in mind . Medium bodied , rather firm in texture , active fine bubbled - carbonation though the palate leaves little distinguishing impression . Very good . ",2006-05-22,sierra-nevada-porter,Sierra Nevada,3.5

I am usually underwhelmed by NG Unplugged beers ( they are solid to good , but never great in my opinion ) , but this is gold . It resembles its patriarch Belgian Red in the cherries all up in the nose , but its main characteristic is the wood aging , which lends a supple and delicate complexity to it all . Not as tart as a Flemish Sour usually is , not as round and juicy as a Rodenbach , this does remind a bit of Petrus combined with the Belgian Red . Musty orange in the glass with ruby highlights , a fizzy but subdued head leaves lacy tracings on the glass as you drink . The warm cherry peeks around vanilla oak and sawdust in the nose , hinting at acid in the flavor . A wash of acid comes first , waters the mouth , then opens up into an earthy woody dark malt . Right after the swallow , the cherry makes its cameo and then fades into a slightly sweet , restrained sour finish that tickles the tongue and features occasional resurgent bursts of acid at the sides . Its like the refined uncle of the Belgian Red , perhaps a bit more tired and restrained , not as lively and in - your - face , but deeper and wiser . Definitely at its best when its warmer .

Pours with a 2 - 3 finger foamy white head which eventually fades to a thick collar with plenty of lacing left down the glass . S - Nose is soft and more sweet than hoppy . Apple , white grape and pear come through upfront with a slightly funky backbone . Soft floral hops accent the nose but are very mild . T - Initial flavor is quite soft and balanced . Floral hop flavors come through a lot more and the fruity flavors are very light but still present initially , a peppery spice and yeast fill the background nicely . The flavors really intensify for the finish as floral hop bitterness and peppery spice come through the most but dry slightly sweet fruity flavors provide a nice balance . A very mild tartness as well as a very mild funk is also noted - the finish is quite dry and leaves you wanting more . M - Medium to high tingly carbonation , and a light , dry , spritzy champagne - like body . D - This is a great , dry , spicy , hoppy belgian ale .

Smell: Sweet - smelling nose of positively pale malts , Sunflower honey , white wine , candied lemon peel , and somewhere between 2 - 5 uncracked cloves . Taste: A sweet taste of pale malts well on the light side of the malt spectrum . A bit honeyed , presumably from the candi sugar , with touches of cereal grains , it reminds me of , in all truth , a bit like Kelloggs Honey Smacks . Splashes of Prosecco . Hint of lemon initially , then some orchard fruits and banana ( still only hints , mind you ) as it warms . Not much hop character or bitterness . Very modest hint of spicy yeast character . Light acidity . Finishes sweetish . Mouthfeel: Medium - bodied . Medium carbonation after the initial head - forming flourish . Drinkability: Seemed sweeter and a tad lighter in the mouth than Duvel , although , as its currently priced in GA , it makes for an admirable , cheaper alternative .

6754,"I poured a 12 oz bottle into a goblet . The best before date was notched at September . Appearance: Beautiful orange / dark gold color . Forms a fairly small , white , foamy head which mostly evaporates but still leaves some lacing on the glass . Smell: Similar to a witbier or hefeweizen with strong banana and lemon peel . Taste: I have to admit I was pretty skeptical about Samuel Adams Belgian Session . This is not a brewery known for making Belgian style beers nor low ABV , sessionable beers - so the two together ? The outcome is not bad at all , actually . This is a decent , fairly tasty and easily drinkable beer . I have a feeling its inspired by the classic Leffe Blonde . And that they got this much flavor out of such a relatively light body is impressive too . there is a light fruity / citrusy flavor at the beginning of the palette . Slight lemon or orangepeel with a hint of black pepper or some kind of cracker or starch component . A bit on the dry side but not ridiculously so . The flavor grows rather intense at the apex with banana and orange flesh . A quick wisp of bitterness as it begins to descend . there is a hint of clove right before it finishes almost completely clean . I am not saying this is a wickedly delicious beer or anything , but its impressive for what it is . Drinkability: Even though I am drinking this beer on an April evening , I could see Samuel Adams Belgian Session living up to its name and intended performance output ( i . e . drinking a bunch of these in the summer ) . Its thin and crisp , but not spastic . It goes down easily and its refreshing while in the mouth . I am shocked there is this much flavor out of only 4 . 3 % ABV as it seems like something heavier . Id take this over their Summer Ale any day . ",2013-04-22,samuel-adams-belgian-session,Samuel Adams,3.7

On close inspection , I got a whiff of grain , light honey , and grassy hops in the finish .

6788,"Fat Tire is a bit of a Jekyl & Hyde beer . Jekyl: When I first tried it over half a decade ago it was something special in a sense . It has an unmistakeable profile that you simply could not find in virtually anything else . As an American beer often mistakenly labeled to be a Belgian that was pretty special . I do not know the last time I tried it with this being the case though . Before it had an aroma and taste almost as if it were a liquified yeast roll . Great caramel coloring with just a hint of sweetness and the hop level was by no means overwhelming . Hyde: New Belgiums footprint has spread out dramatically . We had no source for any of their products after we moved to Alabama until it started popping up in Georgia . Upon acquiring a case we immediately found that the current ""Product"" is by no means the same beast . Maybe certain batches come out more *right* than others ? I do not know . Unfortunately the current product has only the vaguest hint of what made it special before and after buying more at other intervals we have determined it seems to be consistently at this level of bad now . The color is still similar but the trademark breadiness"" is near gone . It has more hint of a toast flavor now than it did previously and the hoppiness is much more noticable than it was previously . We came across a bottle we had mistakenly packed from before we moved and , while a bit stale due to age , it came out very nearly as we remembered it but side by side they simply are not the same beast . If the Jekyl were the current product I would rate it much higher . As such I am probably giving it much higher marks than it deserves .

6805,"Rating # 1900 . Pours slightly hazy copper with gold edges and white head . The aroma is a load of fermented honey and honey like fusels . If your nose wades through the layers of honey there is a moment or two of wheat and sweet malts . The taste is similar to the nose with an upfront attack of honey , honey and then some honey too . But by midway a full tasty wheat note opens up creating almost a hefewezien sensation that makes me feel like I am tasting banana too but I am not sure that is really there . The wheat and honey combination creates a short banana character . As the finish approaches a welcome note of malt , ripe plums and ripe cherries well up to join the fading honey and solid wheat flavors as the experience is carried into the after taste . I love the way this beer finishes but I am not wild about the way it starts . For a new brew at 11 % ABV the alcohol is very well hidden . I have had 8 % beers with bigger booze flaws . Personally Id prefer a wheat forward brew rather than this honey forward one . I am not so sure it will even out with age . I have gone down the big honey brew road before and years later my creation really never wavered or smoothed out . But hopefully this one will be different .

Fructose , sour lactic nose , a very light maltiness at the edges , mainly chocolate . No balance in the aroma , even if you want to call this a Baltic , too sour and fruity , the malts are buried . More carbonation than I like in a porter and the body is too thin and light , no creaminess , no chewy malts , a bland mouthfeel . I am disappointed with the taste as well , weak , wet and thin maltiness , traces of milk chocolate and stale coffee , sour lactic with a watery acidity , more fructose than fruity , I guess the German hops could be that slight medicinal flavor I taste towards the end , and a fructose , thin , watery maltiness in the finish . None of that dry roasted malty bitterness you find in a good porter , just very disappointing all around .

I hope any amateur beer drinker does not write off the style because of this beer , because if they try something like Boulevards Saison Brett or Lost Abbeys Red Barn they will understand what a saison really tastes like .

Definite alcohol in the nose and flavor which was more fruity than you would expect for a lager; almost tastes like an ale with an alcohol kick .

Smell: Fragrant peach aroma bolstered by the vanilla , the lactose . Fragrant enough that it is hard to glean the malt , hop components , but , hey , you put ""peach"" on the can and color not only the can but even the pull tab peach - colored , you might as well deliver in terms of peach aromatics . Taste: Well , it is most definitely peach flavored . Has that slightly tart , yet softly acidic peach vibe throughout . Honeyish maltiness underneath , lightly bready and hinting of , as just about everything does these days , wheat / oats . Hops seem predominately citrusy in nature and deliver some bitterness , though the peach dreamsicle flavorings tend to override them . Finishes smoothly , with lingering milky accents and light vanilla in the aftertaste . Mouthfeel: Medium - plus body . Medium carbonation . Has an appreciably smooth , creamy and faintly sticky mouthfeel . Overall: Peach a plenty .

I have been shuffling this bottle about in the beer fridge and thinking about it with some aprehension since the coffee ingredient thing has me a bit worried . It seems that many overdo this ingredient or some folks live their bitter acid churning coffee . I enjoy my coffee . to paraphrase the Big Lebowski , but only when it does not try to kill me in the process . So after a long weekend working outside on clearing the property of multi - flora rose bushes and preparing the future Hop Yard ( three cheers for me ) , I sat on my porch , took off the work boots and popped this baby open after letting it sit for a bit and assume the right temperature . I was not dissapointed . As I type away here I have a very pleasant low buzz going on from this brew . It currently is assisting in the role of pain killer , since the damn wild rose bushes tore my arms up . Nose is of mellow coffee and some light hops . Black in the glass with a thin tan head that whisps away as if it had never been . No lacing , no legs . Upfront silky malts balance the gentle coffee input quite well .

Anyway , I digress . This is batch 8145 which is probably 2007 . Pours a completely night black fluid with a small coffee colored head made up of tiny bubbles . The oiliness of the beer allows it to stick to the glass . The aroma is not so strong but has a burnt and roasty quality with some sweetness .

With a feel that is already on the full side , the carbonation adds an additional heaviness . Softly crisp , the bubbles are creamy and help remove some of the hop oil residue that remains after each sip .

7010,"Pen & Paper Log ( Aug 2013 ) c / o a gift from a friend returning home from OR . I want to preface this , by saying that when I rate a beer - I always consider what the bottle tells me it is , and I base my rating on that . If it does not measure up , Ill deduct points . If it is something else , Ill deduct points . If however it does measure up , but is offensive Ill also take that into fact . I will also give a good overall if the beer is good , but does not quite live up to what it says it is . Aroma - no surprises the bottle said Peppercorn melange and I figured it might carry that essence - it peppercorn , herbs , and Belgian yeast Apperance - body is yellow - orange , hazy liquid , and about an 1 "" of white foam . Taste - I will give the brewer only one concession , and that is it is Odd & is Peppercorn , its awful - no one can possibly drink this and truly be a having a pleasant experience , unless of course you like abuse . Its peppercorn fluid . It tasted like a slurry of granulated peppercorn . Beer nomenclature hardly fits . Palate - body was medium , texture was on the thin side , the carbonation is lively , the finish and overall experience is awful . Its really bad . This beer , if you want to call it that fails to meet any reasonable amount of balance . It is at best a marinade for meat , and even then it really has to be a savory meet that can withstand its over the top qualities .

The big 3 - dimensional head finally melted into a dark orange body that became murkier the farther towards the bottom of the bottle I poured . the flavor was spicy and lightly sweet , much better than the aroma had prepared me for , but still far from what makes a good Dunkelweizen one of the styles that I really like .

When this came out in the sea of yellow fizzy beers I am sure it was a hit . and that is why its still popular today . When you smell it you first get a smell of floral hops and when you swirl it around maybe a touch of pine and citrus backed by a caramel sweetness . Taste just like this with an amazing almost creamy like caramel sweet malt which gives it a nice body . Then of course it ends with that floral Noble hop bitterness . For a lager the hops shine through pretty well on this its very delicious .

7029,"Fall is here . One sure sign for a beer lover is the release of Octoberfest beers from both German and American breweries . The style itself is know as marzen which has its origins in Germany . Brewers would brew huge batches of this beer in March , lager it in cool caves over the summer months , and serve it in the fall . Sam Adams , along with many other American breweries pay tribute to this style and tradition , with the fall release of an Octoberfest , or fest beer . Sam Adams Octoberfest in the bottle festooned with an orange and blue label , and sports ""the worlds most award winning beers"" cap ( marketing hype ) . Four malts are used in this beer as well as Noble hops . This beer is a very nice beer , but for an Octoberfest , it is lacking . Many domestic examples use an infusion mash when doing this style . The Germans use a brewing technique called decoction , where a portion of the mash is removed to another vessel , heated to a higher temperature , and returned to the mash . This is a very important step in brewing of this beer . The result of this step is the presence of melanoidins in the beer . Melanoidins are the really deep , malty , ""toasty"" flavor of malt in marzen . Some argue that decoction is not necessary , and that with the use of speciality malts , this effect can be achieved . I disagree , my favorite examples of this style , still all come from Germany , and there is good reason; decoction . Sam Adams Octoberfest pours to a deep , bright , amber color . There is a good amount of carbonation , and a good head formation as well . The nose is quite malty , but lacks that ""toasty"" malt character a good marzen should possess . The palate is malty as well , grainy tasting , slightly nutty . This beer finishes with more malt character , and good hop presence to balance this beer out . Over all it is a very hearty beer , very tasty , but not a great example of marzen , or Octoberfest . I would match this beer with a variety of dishes . Roasted pork or turkey would be two of my choices . A very nice beer , but their are much better domestic examples , and of course if you want the best , go with the imported German examples on this one .

Light filmy lacing . The smell takes on the grapefruit and cactus aromas nicely . Light lemon slides in underneath . The taste was mildly sweet with a touch of sour . Dry and sour in the aftertaste and definitely dry in the finish . On the palate , this one sat about a light on the body with a pop of carbonation slyly hitting on my tongue .

7120,"Here is a life lesson: expectation management . that is the name of the game . Go into every job interview thinking ""I am not going to get this job . "" Doing so will help you to relax because you have nothing to lose . Everytime I do this , I perform so well at the interview , I get the job . But also , when you assume everything will turn out bad , any result is positive and you will be constantly pleased with how things actually turned out . I forgot this lesson today when I stepped into the local bar where the Political Science student group holds its monthly student - faculty mixer . It is a dive of a bar that holds out Killians at $ 3 . 50 / pint as the best beer in the house . I told the bartender to let my frosted glass warm up a bit before pouring this to me , but I should have taken the ice and been pleased with the lack of flavor . The color is the only thing going for this beer . In aroma and flavor , I might as well have been drinking Michelob Amber . Adjuncts made my mouth scream and my every sensibility was insulted by the Coors ' corporate assertion that if you give them a bit of color in their beer , they will roll over and lap it up like a dog doing tricks for treats . I think , were I blindfolded , I would have associated this beer with the worst tendencies of American beer production . I could not dismiss the possibility that Coors had substituted food coloring for malt . Musty , dirty flavors , lager body with stickiness at the end .

7183,"Best by 18 th of September; Sampled May 2011 A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two - finger thick , pale , off - white colored head . The beer is a nice gold color that shows a bright , yellow - gold color when held up to the light . The aroma at first smells of cracker malt and a light tartness that morphs into an apricot scent towards the finish . The apricot , once noticed , is a present part of the nose and there also seems to be a floral , slightly herbal , somewhat citrus like component here to the nose as well . Somehow the nose smells light and summer - like , but chewy and hearty at the same time . Cool and crisp tasting up front , as the beer rolls across the tongue there is a nice , soft bitterness and in the finish is a full cracker like flavor that lingers with a light , slightly fruity tartness . The long finish after my first sip has me noticing a touch of distinct apricot flavor . The apricot subtly perfumes the flavor of this beer and adds a counterpoint to the cracker like grain character that is found here . The body is not the lightest , and in fact is a touch heartier than I was expecting , but still this is a beer meant for easy quaffing on a warm day . There is a certain spiciness to this beer up front , some of it is from a lightly peppery carbonation , but there is also a ginger quality to this beer; actually the finish almost has more of a ginger like taste to it than apricot after a while . There is quite a bit of pale malt and grain character to this beer , it is likely that the oats contribute to this , though they seem to contribute more to the body than to the flavor from what I can tell . I really like that not one component of this beer plays the dominant role here . The fruit / spice add subtlely to the complexity and flavor of this beer without overwhelming it . I would not guess there were any additions to this beer necessarily , and that is a good sign when adding extra ingredients in a light , summer quaffer . I am definitely enjoying this beer; light , refreshing , malty , fruity , spicy and even a touch hoppy , this beer is quite complex and I am quite happy to be having a sixer of this . I have a feeling this beer is going to be completely overlooked by the beer - geek set , but I am quite pleased with it . ",2011-06-16,new-belgium-somersault,New Belgium,3.6

7190,"The Sam Adams Utopia marked the 100 th review for us here at 2 beerguys . com , and we were very honored to share the experience with our friends and family . Oddly enough for our beer site , the Utopia has almost no beer characteristics whatsoever . It is indeed , as Samuel Adams has said , that this is a beer brewed to show people the other end of the beer spectrum , to show what a beer can be . The presentation alone is enough to let you know well in advance that you are in for an experience . We did not know what to expect when we popped the top on the bottle , and were very pleased with the blast of vanilla that immediately permeated the air around us . As it is a non - carbonated beer , the visual qualities of course included a still body , as it pours a medium amber color . No head and no lacing , although Wood noted that it has nice legs . Some of the reaction we got to the aromas were of sherry , caskwood , alcohol , and almond . Of course , vanilla has already been noted . I do not think there was a person there that was not surprised when they took their first sip . A heavy hit of sweet on the initial taste , but instead of hops or malts , we got the same qualities we expect from a cognac or tawny port . The finish was hot , with a coating like a bourbon , a little burn follows it down . Ian got a taste of sugar free maple syrup . Mouthfeel gave a medium body with a creamy texture , with a light alcohol finish . Although I can not say this was the best beer we have reviewed thus far , because it lacks so many of the beer characteristics that we treasure , it does , by far , outscore those we have reviewed before because of its incredible stylings and unexpected nuances not expected from a beer . Well done Samuel Adams , well done . ",2006-05-08,samuel-adams-utopias,Samuel Adams,4.5

This one was among a standard New Glarus mix - and - match twelve pack , and I would have to say it was decent but not among the best of the pack . I would rank it higher than the Spotted Cow but lower than the Fat Squirrel , but I think that it really because I am more of a fan of darker brews anyway . With that being said , there are some good things Two Women has going for it - chief among them being its smoothness . It is pleasant - tasting enough that you can almost not notice that you have drank 10 of them in just about an hours time .

Flavor was equally as complex; massively rich and sweet with more fantastic notes of cognac , fruit cake , sweet Madeira chocolate , sticky sweet burnt toffee malts , preserved plums , muscatels , golden syrup , salty notes , and a slight oaky nuttiness towards the finish . Very well hidden alcohol for 17 . 5 % slide down the throat with very little bitterness and a pleasant smooth warming finish . Very full bodied with still carbonation , an amazingly thick ( very mead - like ) texture and long lasting finish .

A sweetness sensation that feels more like fruit juice than honey or caramel or residual sugars . An assertive bitterness leading to a moderately dry finish . Full chewy body with appropriate well levelled carbonation . Tasty and refreshing . Nothing original here but we never have too many well - made tasty IPAs .

7392,"I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this was not simply a nectarine flavored beer , it is a nectarine flavored , hoppy beer , which sounds much better for me . A steady pour produces a two finger thick , pale - tan colored head . The beer is a deep golden color that shows a mostly clear , bright golden hue when held up to the light . The aroma smells brightly of nectarine and apricot , backed by hoppy notes that add supporting floral citrus ( tangelo zest , kumquat zest ) and peach nectar . The hop and nectarine notes play the leading role in the nose , but there is a hint of cracker like malt aromatics . The beer has a perceived sweetness up front from the hop and fruit notes , but dries out considerably in the finish where there is also a light bitter bite . Nectarine flavors jump out of the glass as well as notes of apricot , peach , tangerine , and lots of floral citrus notes . The body is light and quaffable , but with just enough to keep it from seeming thing and the carbonation is prickly and lightly effervescent , which matches everything well . This is a really solid beer , I really am enjoying the mix of fruit and hop character in this beer . It is quite well done & I hope I can pick up a few more six packs of this before it is gone .

A strange beer , it might be a wild ale and it might be a brett IPA . However you define it I am not sure I would have wanted to wait in a big line for any . Time may turn it for the better but as of now it is not one of the better R&D releases . Aroma / Appearance - A golden base glows with an inner mandarin warmth . Fluid legs creep downwards as a funky smell of spicy white pepper , cow pasture , and dashes of hops battle for attention . Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel and texture feel surprisingly neat for a 10 % ABV recipe . Things around the edges feel fluid and unformed as if the core is still finding its identity . Taken as either a wild ale or a bretty IPA it could use some time . Even so it stacks up as a worthwhile beer regardless of when you decide to crack it open .

Finishes with only a pinch of bitterness but its mainly a balance of very gentle smoke , wood , earth , toffee , and lingering caramel . kind of cloying aftertaste , but its not actually as annoying as I feared .

It reminds me of the aftertaste of some kind of medicine it seems I keep gravitating toward . I do not really get any kind of hop presence , but my tongue is perplexed by the aforementioned flavor .

Belgian yeast on the nose and its tart and a little sour . There is sweet clover honey on the nose too . The malt is light caramel and a little bread . Floral and dry . Taste follows all the way . The light caramel is pretty sweet and steps out a little too far to overshadow the tart and sour yeast just a bit . The bread gives it palate and nuance . The fruits are sweet and juicy and deep . The spices dry it out a little and take it to a dry finish . there is some wheat dryness as well and when it all comes together in the finish , that caramel is not what lingers in the aftertaste . The balance was a little off and a little towards the malt but its not unpleasant or cloying . It does drink a little heavy but the pepper and orange in the aftertaste are worth it . Mouthfeel is good , carbonation is lively and adds to the refreshment . This is a stand up saison that combines a very sweet fruit character with a deep malt and comes up a winner with some honey and a spice that tingles . The pepper is so well done and authentic . The That pepper smacks at the back of the throat and stays there throughout the drink keeping a decent balance . there is lemon as it warms and that adds to the drink and let us the spice really shine through .

7546,"12 ounce bottle - $ 2 . 99 at Total Wine & More in Alpharetta , Georgia . Batch # 10735 . Appearance: Pours a dark brown , near black body with a moderate - sized , beige head . Smell: Roasty and fairly sweet - scented all around , implying sugary promises of gooey chocolates and caramels rounded with cooked fruits , phenolic spices , drizzled molasses and a small shot of alcohol . Taste: Sweet chocolate morsels and coffee dosed with a fair amount of table sugar evolve into tastes of smoky molasses brushed berries , plump raisins , toasted pumpernickel , cracked cloves , and understated resins .

7549,"Appearance: A hard pour yields ~ 2 fingers of airy , light tan head . Retention is fairly good , as ~ 1 finger remains after several seconds; lacing is minimal . The beer appears to be black , but when held to a light it is actually more of a dark brown with a hint of cherry red . Again , when held to the light I can see rising carbonation . Smell: The aroma seems to be a nutty mix of toasted malts . it is a bit on the outdoorsy side , but I would not quite describe it as smoky . There does not seem to be too much in the realm of hops , but there is a bit of pungency that lends some ""heft"" to the smell . it is appealing , but not intoxicating . Taste: Much like the nose , this beer ' s essence seems to be that of lightly toasted barley malts . A subtle nuttiness compliments it nicely , but it seems to be offset by a bit of what I would consider to be a metallic taste . Though not blatantly offensive , the latter does seem to add a bit of an odd bite to the hop portion . This also tends to linger once the aforementioned characteristics leave the palate . Mouthfeel: Carbonation is not excessive , so the beer sits nicely in my mouth . The toasted , nutty malt leaves a pleasant sensation which becomes more pleasant as the beer warms . Though the finish is fairly clean , the aftertaste lingers a bit . The body is pretty good; it is light enough to enable quick drinking , but heavy enough to avoid being watered - down . Drinkability: If it were not for the odd aftertaste , I would probably rate this part higher . However , relative to some other dark lagers I have had ( most notably , Shiner ' s Bohemian ) , this beer is fairly light and clean for the style - this helps improve my overall rating . Summary: I suppose this brew epitomizes what you would normally expect from Leinenkugel ' s . it is an attempt at something different , but it does not quite blow you away because it falls just short; it is good , but not great . This was an awesome beer to use for boiling bratwurst , but it is not an excellent beer for drinking . Now , I would much rather have this than some other macro , but I would not quite say that it does the style justice . Again - it is a good beer , but not a great example of what it aims to be .

7551,"Light tan colored head of larger bubbles and loose foam , evaporates with ease into small islands across the surface , zero lacing . While close to fully transparent , vivid reddish brown to metallic orange hues draw your eyes to it , bright and lively . Thick caramel , molasses , brown sugar and candied nuts in the nose , yellow raisins and figs , soda bread and honey buns , mandarin orange , light metallic ring to it , moss and mild leafiness finish the show . Medium - bodied , sturdy and firm mouth presence , the carbonation somewhat tight and gives it punch through the mouth entry . Orange citrus and flowers present at first , just about the sole sign of deeper hoppiness excepting the forest floor greenness and gentle leafy qualities . Malty with all that molasses , toffee , milk chocolate , vanilla bean and golden honey . Apricot , red cherry flavors join the base of raisin , fig , the fruitiness shows a restrained sweetness .

Maybe a more aggressive pour next time will do the trick , but noticed beautiful lacing I got delicious papaya , and mango notes coming through with a slight carmelized alcohol burn . I absolutely love how the tangerine and orange also comes through with a slight , but not deterred alcohol burn . Sitting at 8 . 2 % this is definitely a go - to ipa beer , but I am curious if I will possibly get better head retention from a can .

7567,"This is the second Lips of Faith series that is really impressed me , the first being New Belgium ' s other sour , La Folie .

However , Le Terroir is not without nuances . Lots of orange and tart green apple flavors , and a really cool hop - profile on the finish , which is cool when I burp , because I get hops and not an acidic taste in my mouth . The acidity and sweetness hang around forever on the tongue , and it is far from unpleasant; I am thinking this would be a great summer beer , especially when paired with any type of fruit salad , or an apertif when hanging in the backyard , waiting for something on the grill - really livens up the tastebuds .

The taste has a large hop presence but it seems dryer than the smell , with little else noticeable . The body is good and it goes down a mild tartness that is pleasing .

Taste features tangerine and grapefruit rind comfortably integrating piney hops; gritty , rich malt imparting tones of cinnamon and nutmeg mashing with earthy resin and returning citrus peel through the finish . Mouthfeel shows a medium body with moderate - high carbonation; pillowy mid - palate and extensively clean and taut throughout; malt sweetness seeps into a subdued bitter swallow .

Usually wheat beers in North America come with a slice of lemon ( which is an abomination . in my opinion ) . But the orange really set it apart . As far as the smell , the slice of orange really threw me off . So , I removed the orange and took a sniff of the beer . Had a lot of citrus . I took a sip . I got a lot of strong citrus flavor up front and not a lot of wheat on the back end . When I added the orange , I soon realized that was a big mistake . The orange simply masked the flavor of the beer and made it way too sweet for my palate . Next time I have this beer , it will definitely be without the orange .

7624,"it is black and looks like syrup . Though the head is surprisingly lacking , the little bit of fizz tinges red . It makes the top of this malt - monger look like a Cheerwine . Were there more head , I would rate its looks higher; nevertheless , it appears as described on the bottle , and it looks basically like a cherry stout should . Malty alcohol meanders through nasal passages as it brings with it a fruity ( definitive cherry ) vibe . Similar to aftertaste , it is like an aftersmell . I know it is a stout , and I know it is a beer , but I would like some more cherries . they are definitely secondary to more traditional beer flavors , at least in the waft . Cherry is more pronounced in the taste , but it is got a sourness unsensed in the smell . it is not sour like bad milk , but like I would expect from the concentrate at the bottom of maraschino cherry containers . It also tastes concentrated because , like the smell , the cherry comes thru most in the aftertaste . With each sip , the beer ' s malty body is stomach - bound while the cherry juice pools in your oral cavity . It makes me squint and tend to grimace . I am not totally convinced it would go that well even with a cherry dessert . The malty appeal at the forefront of each sip is enjoyable , but the lingering sour negatively balances things for me .

Completely missing the hopping my tastebuds have acclimatized to , and lacking the overt maltiness as well . pouring a deep golden yellow , creamy foam poured from the unshaken bottle . most impressive head I have seen in a while . the smell however , was very mildly sour , or dry , somewhat in the way of Guinness . no hops really to balance it . As the beer warmed , this became more present , and on the palate as well . the taste was different . totally lacking excessive hopping . If present , the hops were mildly greenish and floral , definitely no citrus or pine . Perhaps lightly peppery .

7636,"Thanks to Cosmohophead for lugging this one back from Darkness Day for me . This beer pours a muddy ruby with a nice 3 inch cap that disappears into just a thin ring around the inside of the glass . The head lingers and leaves decent lacing down the sides of the glass . The aroma is undiluted organic cherry juice . No added sweeteners , no preservatives , just cherry . The flavor reminds me of organic cherry fruit roll ups . Concentrated tartness intermingled with cherry sweetness . Tasty , tasty stuff . For some reason , I also pick up just a hint of chocolate . Maybe some chocolate malts are added . This beer is utterly fantastic . The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy for me but really , that is a little thing . I do not know if this is the best American fruit beer ( because that distinction could go to Raspberry Tart ) but its damn close . ",2010-12-12,"Wisconsin Belgian Red

7638,"I had this beer to celebrate my brother moving into his new house and I was anticipating this to be the greatest beer ever . When i saw the beer It was not the most impressive beer i have ever seen , but i felt that when you make a cherry beer it would look like this , in that aspect the brewer had gotten exactley what they wanted . The smell was wonderful . When you are making a cherry beer you should smell Cherrys and nothing but . That is exactly what i smelled . The taste hit me as medicinal . I do not like to ever speak bad of beers but i could not shake the fact that it tasted like cough medicine . The mouthfeel was an exception to the taste . The beer seemed to be perfectly carbonated and did not give me any reason to review it as bad . The drinkability of this beer was not good FOR ME . I emphasize for me because I know that there are people that could drink this like crazy but i am more of a beer guy and never drink wine . I feel bad to ever give out a bad review but to me this beer was like a fine painting that would never look good in my house but I can thoroughly appreciate the effort and time put into it .

This beer was a dark cherry color . I was expecting maybe a fiery red but the beer was kind of dark . My nose was engulfed in a storm of black cherries . that is about all I could smell . Not even a hint to it being a beer . I would think this is just black cherry soda . The taste was very sweet . In fact , I thought it was way too sweet and a strong black cherry flavor overpowered the beer . There was a slight ketchup taste that I find in flemish sours . It was very hard to get through the bottle by myself . By the end I was in celebration that I was able to finish it . I feel their Raspberry Tart is a much better fruit beer than this one .

7648,"First off I have a serious bias for this beer . It is one of my all time favorite and I have probably drunk more of this particular beer than any other in my entire life . Honestly this is the beer that got me interested in real beer so many years back , back when it was a Colorado exclusive beer and I could not find it on every corner store across America . Now it is a definately favorite for watching a hockey game ( go Avs ) , or bringing along to a party or for post mt biking session . Pours deep copper to amber color with nice dense one finger white head and some nice sticky lacings . Aroma is unmistakable , huge buscuit malt aroma with a fruity aroma like strawberries . Taste is also massively biscuit malt and grainy with just a bit of hops for balance . Some fruity sweetness is detectable but that malty flavor just dominates everything . Mouthfeel is refreshing in spite of the strong grainy malt flavor , Light to medium body goes down very easy and smooth with just a bit of grainy dryness in the end . Nice malty aftertaste is a great bonus . I know this beer is somewhat shallow and it is major attribute seems to be it is drinkability but man , what other beer with this much malty flavor is so darn drinkable ? Also this beer does not truly fit the amber ale style guidelines and is so unique compared to the many amber ales that are available . It is really in a catagory by itself . This is one of the finest session beers in the world if you ask me . Highly enjoyable any season for any reason , tons of flavor and easy to find . Enjoy one soon and often .

7649,"My first beer from Terrapin , thanks to HopDiggityDawg . it is thick , as in , while the color is a dark yellow , it cannot be seen through . it is not so much a haze or cloudiness as just a thickness in the body . The head has a yellowish tint and , while it immediately rises high , it does not maintain that height . It does still keep a sturdy half finger and leaves moderate lacing . The smell is certainly of peaches , and I feel the mark of a well - made fruit beer in particular , along with the strong malts base , which this beer has , is how fresh and in a way raw the fruit comes out . This is all fresh peach in the smell without overpowering , while the wheat - like malts that support it are strong but let the peach prevail . The peach is just as fresh in the taste , a little sweet but far from cloying while a bit tart as well . It avoids the unnatural sourness that comes into the finish of some fruit beers . it is not crazy or thrilling , but it is a pleasure to drink , showcases fresh peach , and offers the malts to boot . The body also avoids being weak or thing , sitting somewhere between light and medium , though after a resolute crispness , the liveliness sort of flashes out a little .

This is a pretty average beer in all regards , but I was not expecting much of anything from this either . it is not summer out , but I can easily see myself having one of these on a nice weekend afternoon ! This had an average pour to it - clean , crisp , and strongly resembling a pils . There was not a lot of carbonation with this beer and the same could be said for the head and lacing . The taste is pretty malty with some bread and honey tossed in for good measure . The only resemblance of hops is in the back , and even so , it is pretty faint . I would also say there is a bit of grass and straw in this , but by no means is this a rye beer . The 4 . 90 % ABV can hardly be felt here and this has ""session beer"" written all over it .

T: The hops and the citrus fruit were present throughout the body , and the finish was long , rye , and bitter , but not overwhelming . M / D: My review does not do this beer justice . I was really impressed by the overall appearance , smell , and flavor . The only way to describe it is delicious .

Great look . What a superb nose ! Rich fudge brownies swimming in a sea of luxuriant coffee and molasses; fantastic ! Not getting much in the way of hops , perhaps a slight whiff here and there , but with a rich stout like this , who cares ? The taste is very close to the nose , which is a plus .

Rich , decadent , delicious . The texture is very silky and creamy ( got to love the oats ) , sliding right down the throat with ease .

Not much retention , but I guess there was not much to retain . a thin layer does remain . s: This one absolutely must be allowed to warm a bit once out of the fridge . Mashed , dark red raspberries upfront . like the kind that are just about overripe and falling off the vine . A moderate tartness tempers the sugars of both the fruit and the malt . Not just raspberry , but a representation of the berry at its peak that showcases its full range of character from rich fruit to gently tart citric acid . In all likelihood , this should probably be a 5 . 0 . m: Carbonation on the lower end of the medium range , a very smooth compliment to the luscious medium body . t: Wow . I was worried that the age might have done some damage , but no way . I think the raspberries and malt may have actually blended into each other a bit more . Delicious fresh raspberries and raspberry compote seasoned with lime juice . Holy shit this is good . Malt takes a far back seat to the fruit , but it provides a very important backbone of both body and flavor . Behind the fruit you cannot taste the grain , but I can tell it is there . The grain also serves to mellow the tart quality of the citric acid , which I am sure serves as a preservative . So much going on here , most all of it involving raspberry . d: a pleasure for sure , the stickiness in the back of the throat is the only detractor As it turns out , this one might be worth aging awhile . give it a shot if you are fortunate enough to have easy access . I would love to do a side - by - side . A follow up with New Glarus revealed an expected shelf life of two years . ",2007-08-19,"Raspberry Tart

Nearly opaque saffron and naples yellow liquid is suppressed by a massive rocky , shock white pearling bulbous crown . Vast sticky caverns of lace adorn the sides with a brilliant glimmer . Superior retention , even for the style . Clove and orange rind in the nose along with a surprising dose of C - hops . Style guidelines are clearly out the window with this brew . Phenols dominate in the yeast strain though there is a hint of bubblegum as well ( not to mention Big Red ) . Sweet supremely spicy palate entry with potent alcohol biting into the mid - palate . Low but persistent bitterness with hints of citrus zest ( a blend of fruits ) , white pepper , clove , and coriander . The wheat presents with pleasing flavor , but dissipates before it can add any tang . Yeast is strong and flavorful as well , but overall the alcohol will not relent . Creamy , full - bodied , effervescent , and a touch hot along the gum - line . Style - defying , flavorful , and maybe a bit excessive in the ABV department ( though never fusel / solventy ) - tastes almost like a cocktail of some sort , albeit one with a base of traditional Hef and home - made bitters .

I have been wanting to try this beer and I am happy I got a bottle to try , so let us see how it goes . 2016 Vintage . Poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a snifter . A - The label looks good , it is got a nice clean look to it , but it is not too eye catching . It poured a nice amber orange color that took on more of an orange color when held to the light with two fingers worth of creamy slightly off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some patchy lacing behind . This is a good looking beer , I have no complaints . S - The aroma starts off with a slightly lower amount of medium sweetness with the hops being the first to show up and they impart a big mixture of citrus rinds , light tropical fruit , light pine and light green hops aromas with the citrus rinds sticking out the most . Up next comes the malts which are on the lighter side and they impart a little bit of pale malt aroma , but that is about it . This beer has a good aroma , but I wish the malts showed up a little more . T - The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of medium sweetness with the hops still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the citrus rinds still sticking out the most . Up next comes a slight clean yeast flavors that goes right in the malts which are just as light as they were in the aroma and they just impart a light pale malt like flavor . On the finish there is a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the hops dominating the aftertaste . This is a good tasting DIPA , I like the hop profile , but I still it had a little more malt flavors to balance it out . M - Smooth , crisp , a little clean , a little refreshing , dry on the finish , well hidden alcohol , medium bodied with a higher amount of medium carbonation . The mouthfeel is very nice and it works very well with this beer . Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style , the hop profile was very nice , it was smooth , but flavorful , my only problem was that the taste and aroma got to be pretty unbalanced . This beer had very nice drinkability , I could drink a few of them without getting bored . What I like the most about this beer is the mouthfeel , drinkability and hop profile , they were all very nice and the highlights of this beer . What I like the least about this beer is the balance in the taste and aroma , I wish the malts showed up just a little more to bring some balance to this beer . I would buy this beer again if I saw it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes an nice and easy drinking DIPA . All in all I was happy with this beer and I was little impressed how they managed to keep the sweetness away and completely hid the alcohol . it is not a favorite Bell ' s beer , but it is one of the better easy drinking DIPA ' s that I have had in a while .

7752,"Appearance: Pours a hazy amber in to a pint glass . There is a sticky white head with some great retention . Smell: The scent is a little on the detergent side with a mild English hop profile . it is not very strong , it is not very bad , it is not very great . Taste and Mouthfeel: There is a familiar flavor of orange tootsie pops to this beer . The body is light and drinks smoothly with little bitterness to speak of . The finish is a little grassy , but crisp with an orange zest aftertaste . Drinkability: There really is not much playing against this beers drinkability aside from it being a rather full flavored brew that I really do not see myself drinking more than a 6 - pack of . Bottom Line: Another shining brew to Bells ' repertoire . I would snag this if you are a big fan of the style . ",2006-12-23,"Amber Ale

7754,"Really glad to have gotten some of this , so I figured I would give a review a fair shot . This beer is one of those barrel aged beers that does not try to do too much . it is barrel + stout and nothing else and it does an excellent job at it . Bottled ten days ago and its a bit hoppier than I like my stouts , but nothing like the hoppiness of Yeti beers / variants . The barrel character really smooths out the taste . Closest cousin might be Dark Horse Barrel Aged Plead , but Plead is a tad sweeter , at least that is what my palette tells me today . It also could just be the bitterness masking it . Mouth feel is great , not too thin or thick . Nose is fine . would not call it anything special . The best thing that I have done with this beer is let it warm . My first drink was at 50 , and that was way too cold . Definitely needs to sit at room temp for a while . If you are a big fan of the non adjunct / flavored format ( I hesitate to say basic , because of the connotation ) of big BA stouts , then this is a must try . However , if you prefer the cinnamon + bacon + coconut + coffee + vanilla + cat piss or one of the thousand other ridiculous things they put in beer these days , you may find yourself a bit underwhelmed considering what this beer is trading for .

Taste , as expected , is a big hop punch up front , same profile as the nose lots of citrus with some pine notes . A seemingly faint malt backbone is present to level things out a bit . there is a strong alcohol bite to the finish that actually merges well with everything else and really kind of compliments things instead of taking away .

7757,"2011 Vintage poured from a 22 oz mega - stubby bottle into a Goose Island Imperial Pint . Hoptimum pours a beautifuly orange / amber body with about 3 / 4 of an inch of slightly off - white foam . The foam holds nicely until I am ready to dive in . The body is nearly brilliant clarity making for a picturesque beer . Aroma is surprisingly sweet with a sharp caramel note running throughout a nice citrus , floral and pine hop bouquet . For the style , I was really expecting a bigger dose of hop aroma . it is pleasant and well - crafted , but not amazing . There are no shortage of hops in the flavor . There is a strong bitterness from the front , middle and lingers long past when the beer is safely in your stomach . it is great to have a DIPA that is not afraid to lean on the bitterness . Fortunately , it is not a sharp , unpleasant bitterness . it is more like a really heavy guy leaning on you to the point where you might almost fall over . If you are fit , you can handle it , but those who are not properly trained will crumble under the bitterness . Through the rest of the flavor is a firm caramel thread that balances the bitterness quite a bit . The hop flavors and resin are really well put together . The resinous quality is quite enjoyable . it is a much more unified and blended flavor that I have come to expect from the style . it is clearly not a single - hop beer , but it is not a kaleidoscope of flavors like most DIPA . I rather enjoy the coating quality of the mouthfeel , but it is a bit heavy in the mouth along the way . it is just a little too dense to be exceptional . Drinkability on this is surprisingly low . The carmel sweetness just adds up too quickly to the point that I simply do not want more . This 22 oz bottle is going to be tough to get down . Recommended for sharing . maybe even three ways over a cheese course at the end of a meal . [Edit: I had to knock the drinkability down on this one as I could not even finish 5 oz without my stomach feeling like I would been doing shots of syrup .

My first review of a sour . appearance is a golden pale with a slight haze mostl likely from the yeast . effervescent for the first couple of minutes then the head dissipates to a thin white ring . no lace at all in my pour . Smells citruisy and earthy , the dry hopping is dominated by an aggresive american hop , my guess would be amarillo , brett is present in the background , but the american hops definetly dominate the aroma in this beer . Fresh squeezed lemonade is what comes to mind at first , but the bittery bite of an ipa is present on the back of the palate . Mouthfeel is smooth and light . thiis a refreshing beer I have had this both on draft and in bottles within a couple of weeks of each other . and the draft version has less tartness , and you get more of the belgian funk , brett , horseblanket character .

7760,"Well . very underwhelmed given the 94 / 100 rating on BA . Perhaps I was seeking something along the lines of a Rodenbach , instead what I got was a Fat tire that had been soured in barrels . I think the Fat tire and friends series had some very comparable , even better , beers at the very excellent price point of $ 1 / bottle ( costco pricing ) . Onto the beer itself . A - Brown , and flat with minimal lacing or head . Ample carbonation in the beer itself , it just was not making its presence felt , which is ok , given it is a sour beer . I have come to expect that not all sour beers generate a head . S - A brown ale with sour notes - i . e . , toasted malt with some faint bread notes , some fruit notes , slight wine vinegar . T - Just like drinking a fat tire brown ale that has been soured a bit . While the fat tire itself is not a very memorable beer , drinking a 22 oz - er that has been soured a bit , was a tad too much for me . M - Medium .

7761,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance The beer pours a golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam . The head fades super - fast leaving just a hint of foamy lace on the sides of the glass . Smell The aroma of the brew is massive of a sweet cinnamon smell with tons of cinnamon , lots of brown sugar , and some heavy caramel smells as well . With these aromas comes some lighter wheat smells , which give the brew a rather inviting sweet churro like smell . Taste The taste begins very different then what I was expecting from the nose , it is actually heavier of a more crisp taste of rice and wheat mixed with some cinnamon . The cinnamon does increase as the taste advances with some lighter sweetness of a caramel and brown sugar nature coming to the tongue . A little bit of a yeasty and clove taste comes at the end , and mixes with the cinnamon spice and lighter sweet tastes to leave a crisp cinnamon taste to linger on the tongue . Mouthfeel The body of the brew is on the slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side . This creates a decently crisp profile for the surprisingly light sweet tastes of the brew and overall is fairly decent for making it easy drinking . Overall Not a bad cinnamon brew , but nothing to call home about . It was easy drinking , but somewhat lacking in complexity . Overall easier drinking for a heavily spiced cinnamon ale .

The foam sticks to the glass thinly , but evenly . I could watch the bubbles drift up from the etching at the bottom of the glass all day . Definite strong crystal malt aroma . Lots of almond or other hearty nut and browned biscuit with syrup in aroma . Wet hops are definitely evident: slight citrus with lots of pine and pitch . Lots of depth to the hops in this one , as the grapefruit is light and the pine needle is strong , supporting the other . The malt is very prevalent in the taste: buttered biscuit , caramel , toasted wheat bread , and slight toffee . The bitterness fades in green like fresh cut grass and gets stronger with time . Bark and earth are strong underneath a somewhat soapy hop oil . Feel is very creamy and balanced . The yeast does wonders to this beer . Scratch that: the brewer does wonders to the beer with this yeast . Slightly dry in the finish , making you salivate for another taste . This is one hell of a beer .

7790,"12 oz . brown bottle from Krogers in Winton Place , poured into a pint glass . A: Bright rusty orange pour that is completely transparent . 2 1 / 2 fingers worth of rocky white head with some great rentention . Finally dies down to a bunch of clumpy islands . Big chunks of lacing at the top followed by good patching . S: BIG floral , pine - y , and citrus hops all at the same time . All the while having a Christmas - y backbone to it . Smells amazing . T / M: Bitterness is just amazing . Very strong with just enough malt rescue to save your tongue . Unfortunately , that is all you see of the malts; A slight sweetness to hold back the hops at the last second . Other than that , the hops are awesome . Big juicy grapefruit and lime oily notes and a pine - y and grassy backbone . Body is medium light with a surprising smoothness to it . Finishes nice and dry with lingering bitterness . D: I will have quite a bit of this throughout the holidays . Only thing holding back the taste ( though not much ) is the lack of a more defined malt character . I know hops are supposed to be the mainliner , and I love that , but it needs a bit further touch of complexity from the other side . I also think this would help the mouthfeel a bit , too Appearance was close to a 5 , also , but I like my IPA ' s hazy instead of clear . Knit - picking , maybe .

Body is opaque with hints of burnt umber around the edges where the light does ( barely ) get through . Head is already down to a rim by the time I take the first whiff . The aroma is very mild; perhaps I poured too cold as it does not seem to be throwing anything up into the air . Hints of raisin and port and chocolate - covered - cherry goodness . Each sip starts with a mild buzz on the tongue , giving over quickly to a roasty , sweet , and . savory flavor . Like chocolate covered beef jerky , but without the salt . Prominent star anise flavor - yes ! that is what it is; now that I taste it , I would almost call this a licorice porter . ""Hell hath no fury ale"" is barely bitter , very malt balanced , only subtley alcoholic , and lacks that certain astringent bite characteristic of many Trappiste ales like Rochefort . In short , I love it . I am not at all a purist when it comes to Belgian - style ales , and I am definitely a fan of this sweet , raisiny , licoricey interpretation .

Retention is above average , and a few wisps of lacing stick to the glass . S: Big time citric hops in the nose . Grapefruit , orange , and tangerine all over the place . Multi - dimensional fruity , pithy , and oily notes . Some sugary sweetness and light caramel maltiness is present in the background , along with some alcoholic presence . Some lighter herbal / candied / piney hop notes are also apparent , adding some dank funkiness to the initial citric bomb . A bit of tropical fruit is also detectable . T: Rather firm sweetness up front , with light caramel and honey tones . It is a reasonably malty beer; I guess the 10 . 4 % abv has to come from somewhere , after all . A huge , bracing hit of hop bitterness quickly sweeps away any sweetness . Huge citric and tropical flavors of orange , pineapple , and grapefruit are at the fore . Lesser fruity and floral hop flavors contribute depth . A second light touch of sweetness appears in the aftertaste , along with some plainly apparent alcohol . M: Fairly full - bodied .

Poured from the 12 oz . bottle into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass . a: Nearly clear amber with lots of carbonation showcased by the narrow base of the IPA glass , inch thick white head receded to heavy surface foam and considerable lacing . s: Moderate citrus . t: More an alcohol bomb than a hop bomb , given the 10 . 4 ABV , but it does not show in the taste . Resiny hops lead the way . Pleasantly bitter aftertaste lingers . m: Moderate , surprisingly smooth considering the 100 IBU / 10 . 4 ABV . o: An excellent IIPA , easier drinking than Torpedo . However , not sure the extra smoothness and alcohol are worth paying more than twice the price of Torpedo . OTOH I may feel differently when the alcohol starts working its magic . UPDATE 7 / 23 / 14 : Drinking a bottle from the 2014 release , SN seems to have changed their bottling date info code , this reads 041114 , so April 11 2014 ? If so the three months on this might explain the raging and not entirely pleasant bitterness . Still exceptionally smooth , would lower the smell score from 4 . 25 to 4 and raise the mouthfeel from 4 to 4 . 25 , so it balances out . Served this at 48 degrees F , will chill the next bottle to 38 to see if that helps . This is a monster IIPA and probably needs to be served as cold as possible to keep its massive 100 IBU bitterness from being annoying .

7820,"Enjoyed out of a green 750 mL bottle and poured into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip . Thanks to Stevedore for getting this to me . Appearance - Very unique looking for a beer . Body is a burgundy , reddish clay color and very cloudy , which gives the impression of fruit puree . Head is a finer and a half of sudsy sandy - colored bubbles . Takes its time dissipating and leaves little to no lacing . Smell - An explosion of sweet and tart fruit characteristics , with very ripe strawberry being the dominant profile . The fruit is definitely the star , and the aroma has me a tad worried that this beer might be too sweet . On the positive side , there is a hint of tartness , like there may be a little pucker factor to this beer . Taste - Delivers on the fruity promise of the nose , but this is not an artificial fruitiness that you get from syrups or the way crappy flavored malt beverages like Smirnoff Ice tastes . This is fresh , flavorful and tangy sweetness , with a semi - dry finish . Unfortunately , the hint of tart from the nose turned out to just be the natural acidity from the fruit . On the tastebuds , the tartness clearly comes from the natural punch of rhubarb , rather than any souring cultures or bacterial . Even so , it is quite delicious . Mouthfeel - Medium - bodied and moderate carbonation , providing an effervescent but substantial feel . In some ways , the feel - not the smell or taste - reminded me of a mimosa or bellini . Very refreshing . Overall , a fantastic fruit beer . I cannot say it is my favorite out of the incredibly broadly - defined style , but it is certainly up there . They manage to make the fruit the focal point of the beer without creating something cloying and overly - sweet .

7823,"Bottle dated 08 / 19 / 14 : Pours a straight golden with a good amount if fluffy white head that dissipates slowly to a gossamer film , with the edges providing good lacing . The beer is quite fact in this pour . The nose , to me , is mostly mango but I get strawberry as well in the fruit side , which is quite pleasant . Underneath I get a farmhouse hay earthiness , which actual ends up seeming kind of funky stale to me . The taste hits the mouth with a decent dose of sour , but it gives way to the mango - like flavors from the nose . When the beer still has a little chill , the sour fruit flavors are subdued kind of surprisingly quickly by the earthy farmhouse flavors I associate with saison style beers . As the beer warms a bit , the sour lasts a little linger , and the carbonation brings the feel more into the experience adding a nip on the tongue . In the end I get just a hint of forest that is actually interesting . I am not sure if I like the addition of depth to a sour . There seems to be a regular beer not - too - well hidden behind a dose of fruity tartness . I liked the tropical fruit tastes with the sour . However , adding the more earthy tones that I assume come from larger amounts of more flavorful hops than might otherwise be used in a sour I think detracts from the part I initially enjoyed .

Pours slightly hazy / cloudy deep golden yellow color with a 1 - 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention , that reduces to a small cap that lingers . Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass , with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap . Aromas of big apricot , pear , apple , white grape , light banana , coriander , pepper , clove , light honey , biscuit , herbal , floral , grass , and yeast earthiness . Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity / spicy yeast , coriander , pale malt , and earthy hop notes; with great strength . Taste of big apricot , pear , apple , white grape , light banana , coriander , pepper , clove , light honey , biscuit , herbal , floral , grass , and yeast earthiness . Good amount of yeast spiciness and earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot , pear , apple , grape , light banana , coriander , pepper , clove , biscuit , and herbal / floral / grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit . Damn nice complexity , robustness , and balance of fruity / spicy yeast , coriander , pale malt , and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt / bitter / spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish . Good amount of dryness from bitterness and yeast spice . Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth , crisp , and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great . Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish . Overall this is an excellent Tripel ! All around great complexity , robustness , and balance of fruity / spicy yeast , coriander , pale malt , and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV . A very enjoyable offering . ",2015-11-21,"Trippel

Well hyped by colorado natives where ever you go , but does this beer stand up to it ? Pours a clear rust color , with 2 "" of white head . Smells intensely of biscuit maltiness . Slight chocolate aroma . Taste is very grainy , again with the biscuits . Hops balnces well . Good , but not ""the best beer in the world"" , as I have heard it called on a few occasions .

7832,"Batch 8881 - Bottled on February 5 , 2009 G: Poured into a Pilsner Urquell pilsener glass . A: Pours a medium nut brown with a smallish single - finger head . An initial rush of carbonation through the glass . Although semi - dark , the beer is mostly transparent . S: Malty and creamy with a slight sweetness . Hints of caramel . T: A lot more to the taste than the small . Sweet malt with notes of caramel , faint nuts , syrup , and dark fruits . Quite complex . M: Light - to - medium body with moderate carbonation throughout . Goes down quite smooth with only the slightest hint of the 8 . 0 abv . D: Eminently drinkable . This is only the second Doppelbock I have reviewed , and enjoyed them both immensely . This seems to be bit heavier in the mouth than the Ayinger Celebrator .

7833,"2002 batch Bottle # 2600 of 4800 . Festive ale pours a deep ruby brown with an off - white head that is full of carbonation and leaves little to no lacing on the glass . The aroma is malt sweetness with a good dose of nutmeg and mace and just a hint of anise . Taste starts with a bit of a spicy hop bite and then a rush of malt and fruit notes . Flavors of pears and apples blend with malty sweetness and flavors of caramel and allspice . The finish is a luscious balance of spicy hops , caramel and chocolate malts , nutmeg , cinnamon , and the first notes of alcohol making themselves known . Aftertaste is a very long lingering sweetness ( but not cloyingly so ) with just a hint of alcohol warmth and hop acidity . Mouthfeel is medium body with a very nice smoothness to it and just a touch of acidity . Overall this has to be one of the best beers that I have had from Sweetwater . A pleasant blend of spices and malts that make for holiday merrymaking anytime you open one . The only down side to this beer is trying to open it . Fifteen minutes with a swiss army knife and you can finally open the plastic and metal swing top coated in hard red wax . There has to be a better way to seal a bottle without buying a corking and caging machine . ",2003-08-24,"Festive Ale

7835,Bottom Line Up Front: I really like this IPA from Sierra Nevada and I look forward to it every year . It is a very balanced IPA that makes it incredibly drinkable . Decanted 12 oz bottle into a Guinness goblet . Apperance: Nice deep golden color that has a good head and light lacing around the glass . Smell: Wonderful floral and citrus hop aroma that does not overwhelm the nose . Taste: I think the hop and malts really balance each other out . Very nice citrus and some pine hop flavors . Mouthfeel: This beer is very balanced and smooth on the palate . The carbonation is quite appropriate for this beer . Overall: I really enjoy this beer and consider this a great IPA . it is very nice clean and crisp with a pleasant mild aftertaste . I consider this IPA very balanced in every category and extremely drinkable . ,2012-12-02,"Celebration

7836,"A nice little extra from gford 112 , he managed to load me up with a lot of brand new GA area beers . I was most geeked over this beer . Its the first one from his box that I went for . A - A nice dark tan head comes in the form of a froth . Retention is modest and lacing is spotty . S - Woah , this is how I hoped it would smell . Nearly . Lots of gourmet chocolate and creamy milk . The beer is not lost in the sweetness , in fact it leans in favor to a roasty bitterness in the nose . The aroma could benefit from being turned up a notch or two in intensity . There is a spot where it seems that two smells are coming together to create a soap - like aroma . T - Way chocolatey . Its truly a treat . Dry , powdery cocoa mixed with rich creamy milk . Its very close to its namesake , a glass of chocolate milk . It deviates from the childhood drink as it hints at roasted malts , just barely . Like the nose , the flavors here do not seem to have reached their full strength . Everything that is here is fantastic though . M - It could use a kick in body as well . The very low carbonation helps it though . Still its incredibly smooth and silky . D - This drinks too dark easily . Partly because the flavors and aromas seem to make me wanting more intensity .

7842,"Part of the Elysian Pumpkin Pack - $ 18 . 99 at Bullock ' s Wine & Spirits in Marietta , Georgia . Experience By: 12 / 05 / 20 ( two days before my birthday ) . While I appreciate pumpkin ales ( as long as they are not showing up early - July ) as being harbingers of crisp , welcome , wonderful Fall , my interest in them sharply declines by middle - to - late November , so we are good there . Appearance: Pours a very dark brown , near black body with an initially medium - sized , yellow - beige head . Smell: An earthy , zesty pop of cinnamon ( more as it warms ) cobbled together with roasty , toasty maltiness and their softer , sweeter chocolate and caramel notes . Slight , perceived pumpkin , without the oft unappealing , under - performing , just - vegetal tone you sometimes encounter . Taste: Chocolaty , roasty with some bitterish tones to it , but also some sweeter caramel , toasty qualities , too . Medium sweetness . Spices perk up midway , and there is some pumpkin present underneathe it all , which , when adhered to the toasty , caramelly malts , gives an impression of dark pumpkin loaf some well - meaning old lady baked for her neighbors three - doors - down . A little rebound of sweetness and spice imparts a final sip of sweet cinnamon . Mouthfeel: Medium - bodied . Medium - soft carbonation . Pleasantly smooth mouthfeel .

Nice pour to this - a ""bright brown"" hue to it with a decent amount of head and some lacing lingering after each sip . The taste was pretty light on the mouthfeel but not light in taste . It was pretty balanced , a slight floral taste with some roasted notes behind it . This went down pretty easily and I do not recall having these in my car for very long as I traveled .

Frothy 2 finger head with excellent lacing leaving gobs of foam behind on the glass . Aroma is a little disappointing , has a slightly metallic aroma although a nice citrus blast accompanies . Reminds me a little of Smutty Finestkind in the smell . Taste comes up very solid . Lots of citrus in grapefruit and lemon flavors . Slight apricot and mango as well as fresh cut grass . Slightly sticky smooth mouthfeel . Overall very enjoyable and thankful for the opportunity . Will drink again . Recommended . Had the opportunity to try this a second time . First time I had concerns it may have been light - struck , which were confirmed the second the super citrusy aroma hit my nostrils . Really an excellent IPA at a reasonable ABV . Highly recommended . ",2011-04-04,"Celebration

7866,"12 oz bottle Visiting Atlanta and wanted to try some local beer , reviewed it so that I remember what it tasted like and whether or not I liked it . No glass so straight from the bottle . A: No idea since it is in a bottle ! S: Nice fresh hops , some hay / grass , lemon , floral ( even from a bottle ! ) T: Not as much fresh hops as I smelled , but decent blend of hops , citrus ( lime more than lemon ) , and a darker malt flavor . A super light coffee bitter twinge on the finish that I was not expecting , not over the top but unexpected . M: Medium bodied . Good . D: A nice local brew , will have again if I see it and nothing bomber is on the beer menu . ",2011-03-23,"Celebration

7867,"This beer pours a nice dark brown color . The head is 2 finger and off white , almost tan . The retention is amazing . Does it ever dissipate ? A few minutes in and it is starting to dissipate , and it clings to the glass like super glue . The nose is interesting , and a bit hard to describe for me . I do like it . I think I am get a roasted malt aroma . Toffee is there . I am getting a rye bread aroma . Licorice ? Very interesting , but I am not doing justice to it in words here . Taste - Lots of dark fruit hits me , plum seems to be the flavor . there is a bread , biscuit flavor that is in there . I get toffee , and a hint of caramel . Roasty flavor . The body is pretty thick and good for the ABV . Somewhat creamy feeling , though , I doubt there is lactose in here . Interesting beer , and I know I did not do justice to it in my review , but it is a good beer , and if you are in Wisconsin , I would recommend getting it . ",2021-10-03,"Gyrator Doppel

7868,"Poured into a pint glass . A - Pours an opaque black color . There are some ruby highlights coming through the bottom . Has about a 1 . 5 finger of tan head . It dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass . Looks pretty great . ( 4 ) S - The coffee is quite prominent , although it is accompanied rather strongly by a caramel / brown sugar type aroma as well . Some milk chocolate in the background as well , and a very slight roast character as well . Perhaps even a very subtle earthy hop aroma but it is difficult to tell for sure . It basically smells like flavored coffee , and it is not a bad thing . ( 4 ) T - The coffee is much more dominant in the taste , as is the roast , leading to an almost burnt malt character . That wonderful caramel - sweetness is here , but not as much as the aroma would have you believe . That earthy hop is slightly more assertive here , and it shows up in the finish . it is quite nice but not as noteworthy as the aroma in my book . ( 3 . 75 ) M - Very nice mouthfeel . Rather full - bodied with just enough carbonation to prevent it from seeming too heavy . Has a nice silkiness as well , which could be from the use of oats perhaps ? Either way it is quite nice . ( 4 . 25 ) O - A really nice coffee stout . Great , almost outstanding in my book . it is definitely good enough that I wish it was a year round offering , although I wonder how viable that would be considering they already offer their standard American stout .

Listed currently on the website at 6 . 1 % ABV . A: Pours a fairly murky - looking amber , a thin veil of cloudiness . Head pours full and fizzy , at one point over two fingers , but fades quickly to a thin ring of tightly - knit bubbles . A few streams of carbonation , but fairly dull otherwise . S: Nothing artificial or overtly spiced about this one: it is all about the pumpkin . Fleshy , earthy , hinted with nutmeg , allspice and cinnamon , but respectfully subtle . Faint aroma of gingerbread . T: Quite earthy , even a little sour / tart . This is a pumpkin ale that focuses on the dirty & musty ""gourd"" taste of pumpkin , rather than on the sweet and spicy taste of pie and spice . Malty in the form of lightly toasted nuts , but with an interesting citrus bite ( orange ? ) , tart fruit follow - up . Is that sourness in the finish ? Yes , certainly a fruit / tart sourness . M: A medium - bodied pumpkin ale , subtly carbonated but with a fuller , more - clingy , medium - full mouthfeel . Not quite velvety , but certainly one that sticks on all parts of the mouth .

Very dark brown and with dark crimson ribbons highlighting the way , Blackbear ' s Bear Hug has certainly been bleached from its black appearance by the oak .

Sweeter on the tongue , a malty sweetness of caramel and molasses adds a chocolate and honey character as well . Moderately roasty , the stout nearly acquiesce to the rum barrel immediately . Sweeter and spicier rum flavors captivate the middle palate with a bevy of slightly scorched brown sugars , butterscotch , vanilla , cinnamon , nutmeg , clove and the brandy soaked cashew nature of rum barrels . Spicy and lightly bitter , the beer ' s late palate goes nearly sherry - like with vinous fruits of date , fig , grape and plum before a woodsy and lightly charred finish .

The fresh hop flavor has some bitterness , but lots of flavors that include grassy , spicy and earthy also . Hints of fruity hops in resin come in also . Just a hint of an oily mouthfeel .

8683,"4 / 07 / 2007 : Atwater Vanilla Java Porter is very dark brown in color ( nearly black ) with a large , quickly dissipating tan - colored head . The aroma is earthy ( like earthworms munching through dirt ) and chalky with some notes of stale coffee and maybe some vanilla . The flavor is marginally better with notes of coffee , vanilla extract , and some roasted malt . It is fairly sweet overall and no noticeable bitterness ( what was the point of even adding any hops if it was only going total up to 15 IBUs ? ! ) . Average body and a bit thin from time to time . Actually , everything about this beer seems to come and go . Sometimes the aroma is chocolate , vanilla , and coffee and other times it is chalky and extract - like . Likewise , sometimes the flavor is not too bad and has roasted malts , vanilla , and some coffee notes , but other times it tastes like an extract homebrew gone awry , stale coffee , or earthy ( literally tasting like dirt ! ) . I cannot decide . I guess if it bounces between ""almost drinkable"" to ""near drain pour"" with each sip , then it just is not that good . 12 oz bottle from The Party Source . 6 % Alc .

9554," ( Bottle 25 cl ) I believe a lot of ratebeerians are missing the point when they slash this beer by judging it by ""traditional"" beer - standards . This is a beer in its own league and not really to be compared to anything else apart from a very few other extreme beers of this world . I have had this beer in my fridge for years , perhaps 4 - 5 years , so I reckon its the 97 vintage . Comes in a cute and cool small , blue bottle with a port - like cork . Black as tar , absolutely NO carbonation . Port - nose and an impressive raisiny aroma . The raisins continue all the way through the beer together with hints of other dried fruits like figs , dates etc . Molasses , malt and an underlying dry hop - character . Sweet and MEGA fullbodied . Gives absolutely no associations to beer - this is Port ! To those who tastes soy sauce I recommend a tastebud - transplant . What a pity this is retired .

Head not as impressive as most IPAs; lacing weak also . Cloudy orange color . Flavor: rather mild for an IPA , but peaches , some citrus , and a little herbal spiciness . The summer description is apt: this is a nice cool - down , rather sessionable pale ale . I would have guessed it as an APA or - were it not for the pine giveaway - perhaps even a pils like Lagunitas Pils , Left Hand Polestar , or Avery Joes with the peach , hop , and spice profile .

Its cool to read here that so much effort went into the beer that was in the bottle , but it was little more than a crazy mess to me . Yeasts and wheat were all over the place in this foamy golden wheat beer . Strong aromas of the usual wheat beer yeast variety with clove , lemon , and banana , and there is an oddly nagging sweetness of dark caramel .

9656,"Reviewed from notes . Thanx Greg . This was poured into a pint glass . The appearance was a dark brown close to black color . Thin quarter white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than forty five seconds . Lacing , yeah , I guess that was there , uh . kind of and in a messy sort of way ( why the hell is every beer I am having tonight has a messy sort of lacing ? ) , sorry for the stupid disclaimer . The smell had a full roasted coffee bean conglomerated aspect of leading to a light dark chocolate and then a light milk chocolate . Both seem to stay subdued enough to not overdo anything whatsoever . The taste was roasty and sweet with a super nice bittering coffee underneath . On the palate , this one sat right at a medium on the body . The carbonation was there , but honestly not bad for the style and for me . there is a light harshness that allows a light creaminess to pervade lightly on through and onto my tongue . Overall , I say this was a good American Stout that I would have again if I could get it . I am glad I had the opportunity to try it and am slightly jealous of the state of Wisconsin to have this on a regular basis . ",2014-08-11,new-glarus-coffee-stout,New Glarus,3.8

9857,"12 fl oz . Brown glass bottle . Truncated review below: HEAD: None . No lacing . BODY: Opaque solid black with amber / red hues . No yeast particulate or hop sediment . Looks typical of the style overall . AROMA: Vague fruit - I guess cherry . Dark malts . Indistinct malty sweetness . Cream . The cherry is not as authentic as it could be , but is not puree - esque or extract - y . it is a pleasant marriage of fruit to dark malt build . No yeast character , alcohol , or off - notes are detectable . Aromatic intensity is above average . TASTE: Heavier on the fruit / cherry than I anticipated . Slightly syrupy . Heavy dark malts , chocolate malts . Some pomegranate . No yeast character , alcohol , or off - notes . Some raisin . it is just not that well balanced for what it is , but I do like it . Not complex / intricate , subtly executed , or nuanced . Pretty straightforward and plain . Average depth , duration , and intensity of flavour . TEXTURE: Smooth , wet , medium - bodied , a biteen too thick . Suits the taste decently , but does not elevate the beer . Overcarbonated . Too coarse on the finish . OVERALL: Not a good execution of the premise . I do like it generally , but I expected better from Bell ' s . I would not recommend it to friends or trade partners . Drinkable .

The wit spices are more apparent on the back of the tongue / after you swallow . I was worried that the berries would make a sweet mess , thankfully that is not the case . M: Highly carbed with a medium level of body ( a little more than I would expect for the style ) . D: A very nice summer beer , especially good for someone who is not a hop fan but does not want a big malty beer .

9971,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of markwise poured into a pint glass . Deep orange bronze with a lovely , creamy head . The bottle says best enjoyed by the end of March . Aroma is less forgiving , with mainly wheat bread notes and a whisper of orangey hops . Flavor is just about the same . With a name like Hopsecutioner , you have got to bring the hops . This falls short in hop aroma , flavor and bitterness . The one thing this beer has going for it is a pillowy mouthfeel . Really soft and smooth going down . ",2012-02-02,"Hopsecutioner

9972,"Poured this 750 mL dark green bottle into a Lindemans flute . No date on the bottle but I have had this one since 6 / 07 . The body was deep garnet / brown and a little hazy . The mild head was pink and faded quickly . Smell was raspberry jam ! Cobbler spices . Fruit and grain . Taste was tangy , tart , and sweet fresh raspberries . Malt sweetness . Raspberry cobbler pretty much sums it up . Strong tart after - bite with lots of fruity flavor . A delicious treat . Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth . ",2010-02-01,"Raspberry Tart

9973,"Pours a deep red into my champagne flute with papaya on the edges and a small slightly rosy rotten raspberry colored head that quickly dissipates and leaves no lacing . The smell is very candy - like . It is mostly sugar and raspberries with a hint of oak , I am not a huge fan of the oak barrels New Glarus uses , there is just something a bit off with it that affects the scent . The taste is phenomenal though , pure sweet and tart raspberry goodness . Not very sour , it is more of a tart flavor , hence the name . I definitely prefer the more balanced tartness over the acid bombs that some of these beers can be . This is a great beer with just about any dessert , highly drinkable , drink it cold . Had another bottle recently , had to dock it , does not have enough raspberry essence . ",2009-11-17,"Raspberry Tart

9975,From a can: This is the worst beer I can remember tasting . I like cucumber saison if properly done ( best I have had were from other home brewers ) but this was terrible . I only gave it three sips before pouring it out . It left a very bitter turnip green sensation at the back of my throat . I could not recognize saison or cucumber on the palate . Luckily this was in a tackle box pack and I had a SW 420 to quickly refresh my palate . ,2017-05-26,"Cool Breeze Cucumber Saison

It pours into an awesome kool aid like red and the fruity aromas are apparent in the smell . Flavors of cherry , peach and grape compliment one another so well . Not exactly a sour ale as it is sweet , but has those juice like qualities that sours do . A real nice summer drinking beer and definitely a great project during Pride month from these breweries !

9991,I tend to stay away from this beer . I am just not a fan of the flavor . I have not had one in years . So for the sake of good record keeping and the fact that we tailgated the and now I have a shit load of these in the fridge . Here we go . Poured into a pint glass the beer is pale cloudy yellow . A modest creamy white head billows out of my glass like whip cream . No laciing left after the head settles . The aroma is sweet grain . Hints of fruit . It has a dust like tone that I am not sure about . The flavor is slightly fruity with malt and a sort of earthy finish . Medium to light body with plenty of carbonation . Overall this did not sway my opinion . To this day this is the only NG product I simply do not enjoy . One out of thirty is not too bad . ,2009-09-04,"Spotted Cow

9992,"120619 stamp . Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass . A: Hazy lemonade / Arnold Palmer hue with 2 - finger white foamy head with good retention and lacing . S: Aroma is more basically fruity than any real specific fruits except for peach and pineapple . High esters which is probably what overwhelms the specific hoppy fruit notes . T: Flavor is good but does not have the depth or clarity of flavors that the excellent and best NEIPAs have . Flavor is full of pineapple , peach , mango and guava but overall it still has a fruit salad congealed hop flavor similar to the hop nose that is not as desirable as the top tier of this style . Big yeast esters are a part of the reason in this component as well , hurting the flavor clarity . Bitterness is low . Some definite alcohol notes in the finish . M: A little chalky with medium fluffy body and lowish carbonation . O: A good stab at the higher ABV version of the style but comes off a bit muddled and estery in both aroma and flavor .
